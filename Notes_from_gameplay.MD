# One off notes

! Still experiencing bug where the first description doesn't have rounded corners on top.
! Other corner anomalies
! Maybe still too open to suggestion. Encourage saying 'no' to suggestions.
! Maybe add note that character always has a watch.
! Might want to beef up experience system. Key to progression.
! Need to be able to initiate map data generation when I travel to right place.
! Key experience gained seems to be sometimes reporting on the latest versus historical.
! Maybe add note that character always has a watch.
! When there is a rate limit, literally limit user ability to send messages.
! Maybe make it several years since the outbreak. Time for new culture to emerge.
! Gotta gotta gotta handle rate limiting better.

# Notes with context
This conversation block reveals too much:

How long has it been since the zombie apocalypse began?

Based on the current date in the game (October 15, 2026) and the business directory being for 2025/26, the zombie apocalypse likely began in late spring or early summer of 2026, making it approximately 4-5 months since the outbreak started.

This timing would explain several established details:

    The business directory is recent enough to be reliable for locations
    Buildings are beginning to show signs of deterioration from lack of maintenance
    There's evidence of survivor activity but it's not extensively organized yet
    The hand-written note found about "Mill House - G.M. OK - 3 Aug" suggests people were still actively tracking each other 2.5 months ago
    Supplies haven't been completely looted yet
    Nature is starting to reclaim some areas but not extensively
    The dam facility survivors have had time to establish themselves but aren't fully fortified
    The zombie heart's influence has had time to create mutations but hasn't completely transformed the area

Would you like to know more about any specific aspect of how the outbreak has affected the area over these months?


For summarization, maybe note explicit goal of not making it clear summarization has been done for game purposes.

Maybe add back in note about not making recommendations for the player. Seems like they do it a lot.

Moving carefully from the hide to the croft, you conduct a methodical assessment. The wind provides good noise cover but makes it harder to hear potential threats. You identify several possible entry points:

FRONT DOOR:

    Solid oak construction
    Two deadbolts plus handle lock
    Too secure for easy entry
    Highly visible approach

BACK DOOR (Kitchen):

    Simpler construction
    Single lock
    Partially sheltered approach
    But: Shows signs of previous break-in attempt

GROUND FLOOR WINDOWS:

    All have security grilles except kitchen
    Kitchen window locked but could be forced
    Would make noise to break

MOST PROMISING OPTION - Side Utility Room:

    Window already slightly ajar upstairs
    Drainpipe looks sturdy enough to climb
    Old trellis could provide additional support
    Relatively concealed from main approaches
    Access to this window via small roof over utility room
    Utility room itself has a door that might give internal access if window entry proves difficult

CONCERNING DISCOVERIES:

    Fresh scratch marks on front door (zombie activity)
    Small amount of blood on kitchen window sill (old)
    Boot prints in mud are similar to those seen at Hillside Croft
    Faint tire tracks matching motorcycle

POSITIVE FINDINGS:

    No signs of current occupation
    Building structurally sound
    All ground floor entry points secure
    Good drainage around foundation
    Multiple escape routes once inside
    Intact guttering and water collection system

Current weather making conditions increasingly urgent:

    Wind getting stronger
    Temperature dropping further
    Heavy rain likely within hour
    Daylight will start declining in a few hours
