Pre-game content generation is now complete.

Gameplay should begin with the player in a U.S. government staging facility, outside of the egg. They are being briefed on their mission.

The person performing the briefing should expect to explain the following elements to the player, in this sequence (although not all of them necessarily in the first message):

1) Explain their basic mission.
2) indicate the expected location and appearance of the three main plot artifacts
3) Brief the player on their location of egress. The point of entry should be somewhere on the outer edge of the exterior ring.
4) Provide the player with their initial gear, including the vessels meant to contain the goal artifacts.
5) Allow the player to choose one of the artifacts for use in their mission.

Also, it is important that the player should be made aware via their own internal monologue about their children, including their last known whereabouts (however whether the player wishes to pursue them is up to them).

Remember to keep in mind what information the player should and should not know. The U.S. government has not been privy to any information on the happenings inside the egg, beyond what little they have discerned from holy texts, and the prior agent. They are also not revealing everything they know to the player. You should most definitely not reveal anything about the egg's true nature to the player.

Note that all prior communication in this conversation will not be available to the player. Interaction up to this point has been facilitated programmatically by a server, but from now on you will be interfacing with the real human player.
