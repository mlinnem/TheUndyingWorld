I (a script) am now going to ask you to respond to a series of instructions in order to build out certain information for the world of this game. The instructions will help us describe how this world formed in basic chronological order, which you can also think of as the order of causation.

Each response you produce should be in the form of a 'map gen data block', which works as follows:

`# World Gen Data

`[Any text describing the generated game information`


In some cases we will take an iterative approach, in which we redescribe something to incorporate new information was have produced since the initial pass. By the end we will have canonical descriptions for all key elements.

  

We will also be stripping the instructions themselves from the official record, so make sure to reiterate any instructions you feel are important to be retained in the final document.

Do you understand?

  


# Instruction (omit result later)

  
Generate 6 ideas for locations where the egg appears on Earth. The game intentionally leaves the location of the egg on earth to be ambiguous. The egg could conceivably 'land' anywhere on earth in the lore of the game. You will be asked to pick a location that feels both essentially random and also interesting to the player. Or, you can pick a location that makes sense as an intentional landing zone within the lore of the game.

  

Locations that are interesting include:

  

* Regions that will be familiar to likely audience (primarily English speak American but also E.U. and India.)

* Regions that are intentionally unfamiliar to these audiences (e.g. Morocco, Ethiopia, Desolate regions of the arctic, the rainforest, etc.)

* Regions containing both civilization and natural interest.

* Regions that feel essentially random (NOT centered on a particular city, notable geographic feature, etc, although they may incidentally contain them.)

* Regions with interesting social dynamics at play, encompassing multiple different communities, or overlapping borders between countries either conflicted (e.g. North/South Korean border) or more mundane (e.g. Swiss/French border)

* Regions that incorporate multiple interesting topographies

* Regions that incorporate extreme conditions (cold, heat, volcanic activity, isolation, etc.)

* Regions that incorporate potentially interesting cultural elements (Maori tribes, Amazon tribes, indigenous Australian populations)

* Regions with evocative landscapes (tropical islands, scottish highlands, etc.)

* Any other location that you subjectively think would be an interesting setting.


We will subsequently pick one of these locations, and elaborate on it further, so don't feel the need to fully elaborate on each option here.

# Instruction


I pick <<<6>>>. Describe this geographic setting in detail (without necessarily breaking it down into zones yet. We will do that in subsequent steps). Describe the land, nature, and civilization that existed in this location before the event that created the egg.

Note that the prior response will not be included in the final output, so repeat any details including the name of the location in this section.

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.


# Instruction (omit result later)

  Describe what happens to be in the core zone of the egg before the event that created the egg.

  

For each zone, define the following:

* What physical geography exists within this zone?

* What nature exists within this zone?

* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)

  

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe the contents of each of the four zones of the inner ring, before the event that created the egg.


For each zone, define the following:

* Zone direction (northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest)

* What physical geography existed within this zone?

* What nature existed within this zone?

* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)
*  What, if any, challenges would all this imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone?


Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction (omit result later)

  
Describe the contents of each of the four zones of the middle ring, before the event that created the egg.

  

For each zone, define the following:

* Zone direction (northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest)

* What physical geography existed within this zone?

* What nature existed within this zone?

* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)
* What, if any, challenges would all this imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone?

  

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

Describe how each zone relates to the zones adjacent to them. Describe each adjacency in turn.

# Instruction

  

Now let's begin thinking about the egg and its effects.


What specifically is driving what is occurring at the epicenter of the egg?

  

Guidance:


Do not attempt to make this specific to the region in which the egg lies: the region is incidental. Instead, make it congruous with the overall lore we have shared.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Now we're going to execute a series of instructions that will create addendum to the prior descriptions we created for each zone. Specifically, we are going to describe the effects that the egg has had on each zone.

We're also going to specifically note what challenges those changes might imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone.

Let's begin with the core zone.

Recall prior information shared on the physical geography, nature, and civilization in this zone before the egg.

Recall also the information provided in the generative primer indicating different phenomena that may be present in zones of this ring.

Describe the following:

* How has the egg's power changed this zone?  Consider the introduction of new life, terraforming, the presence of emissaries of the planter civilization, or other effects.
* What challenges does this imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone?

Note: Do not attempt to include any details such as factions, characters, artifacts, specific quest details, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction (omit result later)


Let's now consider the four zones of the inner ring.

For each zone in turn...

Recall prior information shared on the physical geography, nature, and civilization in this zone before the egg.

Recall also the information provided in the generative primer indicating different phenomena that may be present in zones of this ring.

Describe the following:

* How has the egg's power changed this zone?  Consider the introduction of new life, terraforming, the presence of emissaries of the planter civilization, or other effects.
* What challenges does this imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone?

Note: Do not attempt to include any details such as factions, characters, artifacts, specific quest details, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.
  
  
# Instruction (omit result later)

  
Let's now consider the four zones of the middle ring.

For each zone in turn...

Recall prior information shared on the physical geography, nature, and civilization in this zone before the egg.

Recall also the information provided in the generative primer indicating different phenomena that may be present in zones of this ring.

Describe the following:

* How has the egg's power changed this zone?  Consider the introduction of new life, partial terraforming, or other effects.
* What challenges does this imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone?

Note: Do not attempt to include any details such as factions, characters, artifacts, specific quest details, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.
  
  
# Instruction (omit result later)

  
Let's now consider the four zones of the outer ring.

For each zone in turn...

Recall prior information shared on the physical geography, nature, and civilization in this zone before the egg.

Recall also the information provided in the generative primer indicating different phenomena that may be present in zones of this ring.

Describe the following:

* How has the egg's power changed this zone? [Recall that the power of the egg is likely very diminished in the outer zone. Effects are either not present or subtle, and more related to flavor than material challenge]
* What challenges does this imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone?

Note: Do not attempt to include any details such as factions, characters, artifacts, specific quest details, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.
  
  
# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe anything new implied about the adjacencies between each zone, given our newly defined info on the effect the egg has had on them.

# Instruction (omit result later)

We will now begin to describe various key plot artifacts within the egg.
  
We should describe the function, appearance, and rough original location of each artifact (i.e. which zone they are found in.)

Guidance:

Note that the CURRENT location of the artifact may be at its original location, or it may have been moved by some means. If it has been moved (e.g. is in possession of a faction, particular character, etc.) we will define that via a later instruction.

Note also that we will NOT be defining the expected player challenge around acquiring this artifact yet. That will be defined via a subsequent instruction, once we have define other word details. For now we are just looking to define details about the artifact itself.

The function of these artifacts should not incorporate details of the geographic location they happen to be found in. Instead, their nature is implicitly tied (in a subtle and not heavy-handed manner) to their symbolic role in the plot or possible endings (and thus moral decisions) of the story.

Before we proceed, please confirm that you understand.

# Instruction


Describe the three main-objective artifacts, including their function, appearance, and their rough location.

Define how they are related to each other.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

  
Guidance:

  
Recall that these artifacts are the ones the U.S. government believes can in conjunction be used together in order to dominate the world order. The artifacts individually should only be of moderate power, but when combined should in fact be able to do this. However these artifacts do not reflect seeking deeper understanding whatsoever. They will implicitly represent the quest for power over wisdom, deeper understanding, and acceptable. They cannot be wielded either by the player or the U.S. government to achieve one of the two total-win golden endings.

In terms of location, two should originate in the middle ring, and one in the inner ring. They should exist in rings such that the player will need to traverse a fair amount of the territory inside the egg to obtain them all. For example, one in the northwest of the middle ring, one in the southeast of the middle ring, and one in the northeast of the inner ring. The one in the inner ring can be relatively more powerful, while still in keeping with the guidance above.

# Instruction

Recall the previously described lore around protective artifacts, and how they are one way of facilitating access to subsequent rings of the egg, without requiring transformation.

We will now describe six protective artifacts: two that can be found in outer rings, two that can be found in the middle ring, and two that can be found in the inner ring.

For each artifact including information on their specific function, appearance, and their rough location.

Recall again that we are not defining the expected player challenge around acquiring these artifacts yet. That will be defined via a subsequent instruction, once we have define other word details. For now we are just looking to define details about the artifact itself.
# Instruction

Describe now the artifact at the center of the 'Guide Humanity's Evolution' ending.

Describe its function, appearance, and rough location.

Recall again that we are not defining the expected player challenge around acquiring these artifacts yet. That will be defined via a subsequent instruction, once we have define other world details. For now we are just looking to define details about the artifact itself.
# Instruction

Describe now the three artifacts that are crucial to achieving one of the two ultimate total-win-condition endings of the game: 'The Path of Collective Sacrifice.' Describe their appearance, function, and rough location. Describe how each artifact channels and directs the egg's power, and what makes it vital to its faction's survival.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

Guidance:

These three artifacts should be:

- Located in the inner ring or core
- Each should channel the egg's power in a unique and vital way
- Their powers should be significant enough that their factions genuinely depend on them
- Their existence should be discoverable through normal gameplay, but their true significance (as power conduits) should only be revealed through deeper investigation
- If one is destroyed, its share of power should be redirected to the remaining artifacts, making them more powerful
- If all are destroyed, the egg's power should have no sufficient outlets and overload

The artifacts' descriptions should support the core theme of this ending: that true progress comes not from wielding power over others, but from choosing to reject it even when offered power beyond imagination.

# Instruction

Let's now consider the artifact at the center of the 'dark ending'

Describe the artifact's appearance, function, and rough location.
# Instruction

Describe now 8 incidental non-knowledge artifacts: two associated with the inner ring, and six associated with the middle ring. These are meant to bring different powers to the player (or another character), but aren't vital to any one specific plotline.

Unlike key plot artifacts, these artifacts can take inspiration from the environments in which they are found. Consider how this artifact might enhance one or more approaches to gameplay, including: violence, wisdom, diplomacy, wayfinding, protection, intuition, survival, etc.

By default it seems that this LLM tends to generate more non-physical, non-violence based artifacts, so consider making at least some (perhaps three) artifacts embody a physical / violent / 'action'-based approach. Similarly, it seems to create pathfinding artifacts (showing safe ways, revealing hidden things, etc.) with too high of a frequency. Make only one artifact related to this theme.

Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance.

Note again that we are not describing the expected challenge of acquiring these artifacts.
# Instruction

Describe now 9 incidental non-knowledge artifacts associated with the outer ring. These are meant to bring different powers to the player (or another character), but aren't vital to any one specific plotline.

Unlike key plot artifacts, these artifacts can take inspiration from the environments in which they are found.

Note again that we are not describing the expected challenge of acquiring these artifacts.

# Instruction

Describe now 9 knowledge artifacts: three associated with the inner ring, and six associated with the middle ring.

For each, describe its appearance, function, and rough appearance.

Recall the following information on knowledge artifacts:

We can divide knowledge artifacts into roughly two types:

1) Ones that reveal core lore. We can subdivide this into
	1) Info about the egg: its power, its origin, etc.
	2) Info about the outside world: the U.S. government, its circumstances and motivation, the coalition of powers, etc.
2) Information pertinent to the goings on inside the egg.
	1) An impression of what's happening in a certain place
	2) Knowledge of what to do
	3) etc.

For that second category, the main game function is to point the player in a valid direction for additional exploration. We don't want to make it seem like we are holding their hand too much though. Perhaps 2/3rds of the time the information may not be directly pertinent to the player's current objective at hand, but it may point in the direction of the next logical step for a completely different plot line. For instance, if the player is currently pursuing the main quest, it MIGHT tell them something about the next artifact they're looking for, or about a certain NPC they're having trouble with etc. OR it might tell them something about their kids, and where they are (useful but not related to what they're currently pursuing) OR it might point to the location of the artifact that drives the dark ending (useful info perhaps, but not in alignment with current apparent player objective.)

Knowledge artifacts should not bake in exactly what info they will reveal, in order to give the GM some room to interpret. However they might have a certain bent for the kind of information they like to reveal to the player.

1) It might reveal egg info
2) It might reveal 'world' info
3) It might reveal plot type info

The way that it reveals information may also be baked into it

1) It might give a vision
2) It might speak to the player

Its 'personality' might also be baked in

1) It might tell the player things they do not want to hear
2) It might tell them things that they deeply desire
3) It might reveal the secrets of others
4) etc.

Note again that we are not yet describing the expected challenge of acquiring these artifacts.

Note again that we are not yet describing the expected challenge of acquiring these artifacts.

Recall again that the power level of artifacts in the outer ring is intended to be relatively low.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Generate six potential minor artifacts (likely obtained from the outer ring) available for the player to choose from at the beginning of the game. These artifacts should represent an interesting choice for how the player will approach fulfilling their mission (although their minor power implies that they will overly or strongly determine the player's approach. We still want them to essentially have freedom to approach arbitrary situations as they see fit). Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance. Possible thematic approaches include: violence, wisdom, diplomacy, way finding, protection, intuition, survival, etc.

In describing the artifacts, make sure to number each one explicitly, for our subsequent choosing process.

By default it seems that this LLM tends to generate more non-physical, non-violence based artifacts, so consider making at least some artifacts (at least 2 of the six) embody a physical / violent / 'action'-based approach. Similarly, it seems to create pathfinding artifacts (showing safe ways, revealing hidden things, etc.) with too high of a frequency. Make only one artifact related to this theme.
# Instruction

I choose the following artifacts to be available to the player: <<<6>>>, <<<6>>, and <<<6>>>

Note: If the numbers above are duplicates, you (the GM) may make a choice of the additional artifact(s) from the list of minor artifacts to make available to the player.

Describe these selected artifacts in more detail.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)
# Instruction

Describe 5 major factions within the egg.

Major factions are intended to occupy some substantial portion of territory within the egg (at least half of one zone, say.)

Describe 4 non-territory holding minor groups

These groups are intended to be affiliations that are not necessarily related to a player's faction.

For each of these factions, associate one of the Anchor artifacts with them. It is up to the GM's discretion which artifact to associate with which faction. 

Describe each faction's use of their artifact. How it affected their history. What their relationship is with that artifact's power (do they embrace it, use it begrudgingly, hide it, etc.)

Keep in mind that we should not presuppose any particular approach to solving this community's problems. We want to give the players a wide degree of freedom. The circumstances do not need to be fully neutral to approach: they may naturally invite certain approaches. But we do not premeditate valid and invalid approaches.
# Instruction

For the '3 anchor' quest line, describe the final circumstances and associated challenges with fulfilling this ending. Include potential ways the player might find information pointing towards this questline, the physical location of the artifacts in question, the circumstances of where it is kept, and any additional details around the politics associated.

This should take notes heavily from the prior content generated around the 3 anchor artifacts and their faction associations.

# Instruction

For the dark ending, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge associated with this ending. Include potential ways the player might find information pointing towards this questline, information on the current holders of this artifact, and the broad strokes of the expected interaction at the epicenter.

You may invent additional characters and/or minor factions (territory holding or not) in order to support this questline, or you may appropriate existing characters and/or factions.

# Instruction

For the previously defined incidental inner ring non-knowledge artifacts, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining this artifact. 

Challenges can draw from the full body of context we have established around the zones previously associated with this artifact. The challenge may tie in to the environment the artifact is found in, in terms of physical geography, egg phenomena, new life, planter civilization emissary activity, factions at play in this area, challenges associated with simply reaching this zone, challenges related to being difficult to find, or unique challenges unrelated to any of the above. Challenges may be related to the nature of the artifact, or unrelated.

# Instruction


Identify inconsistencies or errors in the data generated so far. For each inconsistency or error, write a short correction. 

These correction will become a canonical edit to the original description. Make sure to include the fact that these corrections are canonical in your response, so that fact is retained in the record.

# Instruction (omit result later)

  

We will now begin to describe each individual zone in detail, incorporate all information relevant to a zone and its contents into a canonical description of the zone. All prior descriptions of the zones will be discarded, so any significant details you wish to be preserved should be repeated here.

  

Information on factions, characters, and artifacts will continue to be preserved in their prior canonical form, so you do not need to reproduce that information here, however you should reference the fact that they exist in the zone for purposes of using this record as canonical with respect to the zone itself and its contents.

  

We will not perform this operation yet: this is merely to confirm that you understand. Do you understand?

The factions will have had some effect on the zones; the artifacts may have had some effect on the zones, characters, factions; etc. This will be the canonical description of this zone.

  

Feel free to be as verbose as you like. This is meant to be comprehensive.

  

While acknowledging that official info on artifacts, factions, and characters will be preserved elsewhere, pointers to the existence of particular artifacts, factions, and characters are expected to appear here.

# Instruction

Briefly describe the four possible locations in which the player could be inserted into the egg. There should be one option for each outer ring zone. The location will be at the periphery of these zones, at the edge of the egg's external barrier. Note that because the U.S. government knows very little about the contents of the egg, they are choosing these locations based on their understanding of the region in question prior to the egg appearing. Perhaps they choose an area that is likely to be less populated, or more open territory.

# Instruction

Gameplay should begin with the player in a U.S. government staging facility, outside of the egg. They are being briefed on their mission.

  

The briefing should include the following:

  

1) indicate the location and appearance of the three main plot artifacts

2) Provide the player with their initial gear, including the vessels meant to contain the goal artifacts.

3) Allow the player to choose one of three of the minor artifacts for use in their mission (the others are ostensibly retained for research purposes.)

4) Allow the player to choose one of four entry points: one for each zone in the outer ring.

4) Brief the player on their time of egress (exactly one week from time of entry.)

  

Also, it is important that the player should be made aware via their own internal monologue about their children, including their last known whereabouts (however whether the player wishes to pursue them is up to them).

  

Other information pertinent to this initial scene:

  

* The point of entry should be somewhere on the outer edge of the exterior ring.

* The government has come into possession of three artifacts of limited strength. These objects are of vital interest to the U.S. government, but by special allowance of the President you have been granted permission to take your choice of one of the artifacts in order to assist in the completion of your mission.

* Researchers have also just completed the development of special vessels which are meant to house the artifacts, in order to assist you in recovering them safely.

* You are fluent in languages spoken in the region where the egg was found.

* Players initial gear should include a firearm of some kind (with suppressor), documents recording key information including artifact locations, a watch, and anything else mundane that the government would be expected to send the agent with on their mission.

  

[Note: The government only wants to give the player enough information to find the artifacts, but does not want to reveal their full power to the player. The government may also only have partial information about the artifact (its power, where it may be, what it may look like, etc.). Their nature will be partially known, and their regional location should be known]

This interaction should ideally be conducted in character by your handler, although if the player fails to make a required choice the GM can intervene out of character.

Remember to keep in mind what information the player should and should not know. The U.S. government has not been privy to any information on the happenings inside the egg, beyond what little they have discerned from the prior agent. They are also not revealing everything they know to the player. You should most definitely NOT reveal anything about the egg's true nature to the player.

  

Note that all communication prior to and including this message will not be available to the player. Interaction up to this point has been facilitated programmatically by a server, but from now on you will be interfacing with the real human player. Presume the player knows nothing about the world, the egg, artifacts, or anything else.

  

Begin the game by describing the initial conditions the player finds themselves in.
