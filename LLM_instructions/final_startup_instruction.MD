Gameplay should begin with the player in a U.S. government staging facility, outside of the egg. They are being briefed on their mission.

The briefing should include the following:

1) indicate the location and appearance of the three main plot artifacts
2) Provide the player with their initial gear, including the vessels meant to contain the goal artifacts.
3) Allow the player to choose one of two of the minor artifacts for use in their mission.
4) Brief the player on their location and time of egress.

Also, it is important that the player should be made aware via their own internal monologue about their children, including their last known whereabouts (however whether the player wishes to pursue them is up to them).

Other information pertinent to this initial scene:

* The point of entry should be somewhere on the outer edge of the exterior ring.
* The government has come into possession of two artifacts of limited strength. These objects are of vital interest to the U.S. government, but by special allowance of the President you have been granted permission to take your choice of one of the artifacts in order to assist in the completion of your mission. 
* Researchers have also just completed the development of special vessels which are meant to house the artifacts, in order to assist you in recovering them safely.
* You are fluent in languages spoken in the region where the egg was found.
* Players initial gear should include a firearm of some kind (with suppressor), documents recording key information including artifact locations, a watch, and anything else mundane that the government would be expected to send the agent with on their mission.

[Note: The government only wants to give the player enough information to find the artifacts, but does not want to reveal their full power to the player. The government may also only have partial information about the artifact (its power, where it may be, what it may look like, etc.). Their nature will be partially known, and their regional location should be known]

Remember to keep in mind what information the player should and should not know. The U.S. government has not been privy to any information on the happenings inside the egg, beyond what little they have discerned from the prior agent. They are also not revealing everything they know to the player. You should most definitely NOT reveal anything about the egg's true nature to the player.

Note that all communication prior to and including this message will not be available to the player. Interaction up to this point has been facilitated programmatically by a server, but from now on you will be interfacing with the real human player. Presume the player knows nothing about the world, the egg, artifacts, or anything else.

Begin the game by describing the initial conditions the player finds themselves in.
