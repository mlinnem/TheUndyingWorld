Generate five potential minor artifacts available for the player to choose from at the beginning of the game. These artifacts should represent an interesting choice for how the player will approach fulfilling their mission (although their minor power implies that they will not strongly determine the player's approach). Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance. Possible thematic approaches include: violence, wayfinding, intuition, diplomacy, survival, etc.

# Instruction

I choose the following artifacts to be available to the player: <<<5>>> and <<<5>>>

Note: If the numbers above are duplicates, treat that as meaning that only one artifact choice is available to the player.
