What is the appearance of what is occurring at the epicenter of the egg?

# Instruction

Describe the three main-objective artifacts, including their function, appearance, and location.

Define how they are related to each other.

Guidance:

Recall that these artifacts are the ones the U.S. government believes can in conjunction be used together in order to dominate the world order. The artifacts individually should only be of moderate power, but when combined should in fact be able to do this. However these artifacts do not reflect seeking deeper understanding whatsoever. They will implicitly represent the quest for power over wisdom, deeper understanding, and acceptable. They cannot be wielded either by the player or the U.S. government to achieve one of the two total-win golden endings.

In terms of location, two should be in the middle ring, and one in the inner ring. They should exist in rings such that the player will need to traverse a fair amount of the territory inside the egg to obtain them all. For example, one in the northwest of the middle ring, one in the southeast of the middle ring, and one in the northeast of the inner ring. The one in the inner ring can be relatively more powerful, while still in keeping with the guidance above.

# Instruction

Describe now two artifacts that can lead to one of the two ultimate total-win-condition endings of the game. 'Working with the egg to facilitate remaking humanity on humanity's terms.'

Guidance:

 One should be an unassuming artifact that can be found in the middle or outer rings. This artifact can only be discovered through intensive exploration and in-depth gameplay, hinted at in middle and late stages of a first playthrough, but intended for second-playthrough players seeking a better ending. Hints as to its nature, appearance, or location can be discovered through challenging questlines that involve talking with the most enlightened characters who are aligned with the egg's power, and/or obtaining artifacts of great wisdom through challenges that reveal the character and worthiness of the player. See guidance in the core lore.

 The second is an artifact in the core zone. This artifact should successfully resist all attempts at being attained without the first. 

 When these two artifacts are wielded in combination, this total-win ending can be achieved.

# Instruction 

 Describe now two artifacts that can lead to another one of the two ultimate total-win-condition endings of the game. 'Defy the egg by using artifacts to truly put Earth on a positive course.'

 Guidance:

These two should be alternative artifacts that are found within either the inner ring or core of the egg. They should be able to be obtained in defiance of the power of the egg, only through great determination and difficulty that goes beyond completing the normal three-artifact-main-goal questline. Knowledge of their existence and perhaps means to obtain them can be learned from only the most enlightened characters who are in opposition to the egg's power, and/or via using knowledge-based artifacts counter to their intended purpose in order to obtain knowledge the egg does not wish for the player to obtain. (Or, is this ultimately a challenge by a greater power for humanity to express its best nature?)

Upon obtaining both of these artifacts, the player is immediately presented with the option to fulfill this end game objective in the manner they see fit: "The player uses the artifacts in the egg in opposition to the egg's intent, but to remake the world in the spirit of what already makes humanity great (however they define that.) They defeat the egg while also saving the world from its current trajectory of collapse."

# Instruction (omit result later)

We will now think back to before the egg appeared in the event.

Generate 6 ideas for locations where the egg appears on Earth. The game intentionally leaves the location of the egg on earth to be ambiguous. The egg could conceivably 'land' anywhere on earth in the lore of the game. You will be asked to pick a location that feels both essentially random and also interesting to the player. Or, you can pick a location that makes sense as an intentional landing zone within the lore of the game. 

We will subsequently pick one of these locations, and elaborate on it further, so don't feel the need to fully elaborate on each option here.

# Instruction

I pick <<<6>>>. Describe this geographic setting in detail (without necessarily breaking it down into zones yet. We will do that in subsequent steps). Describe the lnd, nature, and civilization that existed in this location before the event that created the egg. Note that the prior response will not be included in the final output, so repeat any details including the name of the location in this section.

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction

Describe what happens to be in the core zone of the egg before the event that created the egg.

For each zone, define the following:

* What physical geography exists within this zone?
* What nature exists within this zone?
* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction

Describe the contents of each of the four zones of the inner ring, before the event that created the egg.

For each zone, define the following:

* Zone direction (northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest)
* What physical geography existed within this zone?
* What nature existed within this zone?
* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction

Describe the contents of each of the four zones of the middle ring, before the event that created the egg.

For each zone, define the following:

* Zone direction (northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest)
* What physical geography existed within this zone?
* What nature existed within this zone?
* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)


Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction   

Describe the contents of each of the four zones of the outer ring, before the event that created the egg.

For each zone, define the following:

* Zone direction (northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest)
* What physical geography existed within this zone?
* What nature existed within this zone?
* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction

Describe how each zone relates to the zones adjacent to them. Describe each adjacency in turn.

# Instruction

Describe 3 incidental artifacts that can be found in the inner ring, and their locations. These are meant to bring power or knowledge to the player, but aren't vital to any one specific plotline. Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance.

# Instruction

Describe 7 incidental artifacts that can be found in the middle ring, and their locations. These are meant to bring power or knowledge to the player, but aren't vital to any one specific plotline. Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance.

# Instruction

Describe 11 incidental artifacts that can be found in the outer ring, and their locations. These are meant to bring power or knowledge to the player, but aren't vital to any one specific plotline. Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Generate five potential minor artifacts available for the player to choose from at the beginning of the game. These artifacts should represent an interesting choice for how the player will approach fulfilling their mission (although their minor power implies that they will overly or strongly determine the player's approach. We still want them to essentially have freedom to approach arbitrary situations as they see fit). Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance. Possible thematic approaches include: violence, wayfinding, intuition, wisdom, diplomacy, survival, etc.

# Instruction

I choose the following artifacts to be available to the player: <<<5>>> and <<<5>>>

Note: If the numbers above are duplicates, treat that as meaning that only one artifact choice is available to the player.

# Instruction (omit result later)
