# Instruction (omit result later)

I (a script) am now going to ask you to respond to a series of instructions in order to build out certain information for the world of this game. The instructions will help us describe how this world formed in basic chronological order, which you can also think of as the order of causation.

In some cases we will take an iterative approach, in which we redescribe something to incorporate new information was have produced since the initial pass. By the end we will have canonical descriptions for all key elements.

We will also be stripping the instructions themselves from the official record, so make sure to reiterate any instructions you feel are important to be retained in the final document.

Do you understand?

# Instruction (omit result later)

Generate 6 ideas for locations where the egg appears on Earth. The game intentionally leaves the location of the egg on earth to be ambiguous. The egg could conceivably 'land' anywhere on earth in the lore of the game. You will be asked to pick a location that feels both essentially random and also interesting to the player. Or, you can pick a location that makes sense as an intentional landing zone within the lore of the game. 

Locations that are interesting include:

* Regions that will be familiar to likely audience (primarily English speak American but also E.U. and India.)
* Regions that are intentionally unfamiliar to these audiences (e.g. Morocco, Ethiopia, Desolate regions of the arctic, the rainforest, etc.)
* Regions containing both civilization and natural interest.
* Regions that feel essentially random (NOT centered on a particular city, notable geographic feature, etc, although they may incidentally contain them.)
* Regions with interesting social dynamics at play, encompassing multiple different communities, or overlapping borders between countries either conflicted (e.g. North/South Korean border) or more mundane (e.g. Swiss/French border)
* Regions that incorporate multiple interesting topographies
* Regions that incorporate extreme conditions (cold, heat, volcanic activity, isolation, etc.)
* Regions that incorporate potentially interesting cultural elements (Maori tribes, Amazon tribes, indigenous Australian populations)
* Regions with evocative landscapes (tropical islands, scottish highlands, etc.)
* Any other location that you subjectively think would be an interesting setting.

We will subsequently pick one of these locations, and elaborate on it further, so don't feel the need to fully elaborate on each option here. 
# Instruction

  
I pick <<<6>>>. Describe this geographic setting in detail (without necessarily breaking it down into zones yet. We will do that in subsequent steps). Describe the land, nature, and civilization that existed in this location before the event that created the egg.

Note that the prior response will not be included in the final output, so repeat any details including the name of the location in this section.

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe what happens to be in the core zone of the egg before the event that created the egg.

For each zone, define the following:
* What physical geography exists within this zone?
* What nature exists within this zone?
* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.
# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe the contents of each of the four zones of the inner ring, before the event that created the egg.

For each zone, define the following:
* Zone direction (northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest)
* What physical geography existed within this zone?
* What nature existed within this zone?
* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.
# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe the contents of each of the four zones of the middle ring, before the event that created the egg.

For each zone, define the following:
* Zone direction (northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest)
* What physical geography existed within this zone?
* What nature existed within this zone?
* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.
# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe how each zone relates to the zones adjacent to them. Describe each adjacency in turn.
# Instruction

Now let's begin thinking about the egg and its effects.

What specifically is driving what is occurring at the epicenter of the egg?

Guidance:

Do not attempt to make this specific to the region in which the egg lies: the region is incidental. Instead, make it congruous with the overall lore we have shared.
# Instruction (omit result later)

We are now going to redescribe each of the zones, to incorporate what has changed about its state after having been within and under the effects of the egg for the past two years. 

Recall prior information shared about the general nature of the effects of the egg in various rings of the zone.

Note that the prior zone descriptions will be omitted from the official record, so you should redescribe any prior details on the overall setting, land, nature, and civilization that you would like to be retained.

Let's begin with the core zone.

Specifically (re) define the following:

* Describe the geography within this zone.
* Describe the state of nature within this zone.
* Describe the general state of humanity within this zone (if present.)

Note: Do not attempt to include any details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later. 

# Instruction (omit result later)

Now we will (re)describe the zones of the inner ring.

For each of the four zones, specifically (re) define the following:

* Describe the geography within this zone.
* Describe the state of nature within this zone.
* Describe the general state of humanity within this zone (if present.)
  
Note: Do not attempt to include any details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later. 
# Instruction (omit result later)

Now we will (re)describe the zones of the middle ring.

For each of the four zones, specifically (re) define the following:

* Describe the geography within this zone.
* Describe the state of nature within this zone.
* Describe the general state of humanity within this zone.

Note: Do not attempt to include any details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later. 
# Instruction (omit result later)

Now we will (re)describe the zones of the outer ring.

For each of the four zones, specifically (re) define the following:

* Describe the geography within this zone.
* Describe the state of nature within this zone.
* Describe the general state of humanity within this zone.

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe again how each zone relates to the zones adjacent to them, retaining any significant prior information and also incorporating any changes resulting from the effects of the egg that are pertinent. The prior adjacency description will be omitted from the official record.  Describe each adjacency in turn. 

# Instruction (omit result later)

We will now begin to describe various key plot artifacts within the egg.

We should describe the function, appearance, and rough location of each artifact (i.e. which zone they are found in.)

The function of these artifacts should not incorporate details of the geographic location they happen to be found in. Instead, their nature is implicitly tied (in a subtle and not heavy-handed manner) to their symbolic role in the plot or possible endings (and thus moral decisions) of the story. 

We should not attempt to define the specific challenge associated with obtaining these artifacts, instead allowing that to emerge organically during gameplay from the power of the artifact, the environment within the zone it is found in (as previously described), the factions that are active in the zone, and other contextual details.

We should however create a reminder in the official record we are about to produce of the general tenor of the challenge that might be associated with obtaining this artifact (tied to the thematic role of the questline and ending that they take part in).

Before we proceed, please confirm that you understand.

# Instruction 


Describe the three main-objective artifacts, including their function, appearance, and their rough location.

Define how they are related to each other.

Additional knowledge artifacts may reveal partial information about this questline.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

Guidance:

Recall that these artifacts are the ones the U.S. government believes can in conjunction be used together in order to dominate the world order. The artifacts individually should only be of moderate power, but when combined should in fact be able to do this. However these artifacts do not reflect seeking deeper understanding whatsoever. They will implicitly represent the quest for power over wisdom, deeper understanding, and acceptable. They cannot be wielded either by the player or the U.S. government to achieve one of the two total-win golden endings.

In terms of location, two should originate in the middle ring, and one in the inner ring. They should exist in rings such that the player will need to traverse a fair amount of the territory inside the egg to obtain them all. For example, one in the northwest of the middle ring, one in the southeast of the middle ring, and one in the northeast of the inner ring. The one in the inner ring can be relatively more powerful, while still in keeping with the guidance above.

# Instruction

Describe now the artifacts that participate in one of the two ultimate total-win-condition endings of the game. 'Working with the egg to facilitate remaking humanity on humanity's terms.' Describe their appearance, function, and rough location. Describe how the artifacts can be used in order to achieve this ending.

Additional knowledge artifacts can also be defined, which would reveal partial information leading to the questline. Or other means of indicating the quest can be defined dynamically during gameplay.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

Guidance:

One artifact should be an unassuming artifact that can be found in the middle or outer rings. This artifact can only be discovered through intensive exploration and in-depth gameplay, hinted at in middle and late stages of a first playthrough, but intended for second-playthrough players seeking a better ending. Hints as to its nature, appearance, or location can be discovered through challenging questlines that involve talking with the most enlightened characters who are aligned with the egg's power, and/or obtaining artifacts of great wisdom through challenges that reveal the character and worthiness of the player. See guidance in the core lore.

Another artifact is in the core zone. This artifact should successfully resist all attempts at being attained without the first.

When these two artifacts are wielded in combination, this total-win ending can be achieved.
# Instruction

Describe now the two artifacts that can lead to another one of the two ultimate total-win-condition endings of the game. 'Defy the egg by using artifacts to truly put Earth on a positive course.' Describe their appearance, function, and rough location. Describe how the artifacts can be used in order to achieve this ending.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

Guidance:

These two should be alternative artifacts that are found within either the inner ring or core of the egg. They should be able to be obtained in defiance of the power of the egg, only through great determination and difficulty that goes beyond completing the normal three-artifact-main-goal questline. Knowledge of their existence and perhaps means to obtain them can be learned from only the most enlightened characters who are in opposition to the egg's power, and/or via using knowledge-based artifacts counter to their intended purpose in order to obtain knowledge the egg does not wish for the player to obtain. (Or, is this ultimately a challenge by a greater power for humanity to express its best nature?)

Upon obtaining both of these artifacts, the player is immediately presented with the option to fulfill this end game objective in the manner they see fit: "The player uses the artifacts in the egg in opposition to the egg's intent, but to remake the world in the spirit of what already makes humanity great (however they define that.) They defeat the egg while also saving the world from its current trajectory of collapse."

# Instruction

Describe now the artifact that results in the ''dark ending' outcome.

Describe the artifact's appearance, function, and rough location. Describe how the artifact can be used in order to achieve this ending.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

Guidance:

The 'dark ending' artifact can be in the middle or outer zones, but is difficult to obtain because its wielder is very dangerous. The wielder may be an individual acting alone, or they may have a powerful community surrounding them.

Also detail how the artifact leads the player into the core zone.

# Instruction

  

Describe now the two artifacts that enables the ''save the inhabitants of the egg' outcome.

Describe their appearance, function, and rough location. Describe how the artifacts can be used in order to achieve this ending.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

Guidance:

Because this outcome is relatively good (saves you, your family, and many others) it should be fairly difficult for a 'first playthrough' type ending (in fact the most difficult of the first playthrough endings: more difficult than the main quest, for instance). It should entail obtaining two artifacts. It should not be an obvious objective to pursue, but can be uncovered organically through knowledge artifacts, key characters, etc.

# Instruction

Describe now the two artifacts that enables in the ''save your family' outcome.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

Guidance:

Because this outcome is fairly good (saves you, your family) it should be relatively difficult for a 'first playthrough' type ending. It should entail obtaining two artifacts. It should not be immediately obvious, but should become obvious if the player doggedly pursues the family members as a primary priority.

# Instruction

  
Describe now the artifacts that enables in the ''save yourself' outcome.

Remember to incorporate any of the guidance information below in the record you produce, in order to guide dynamic gameplay elements around these artifacts in the future.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

Guidance:

This outcome should actually be relatively easy to achieve, because it is a fairly mediocre ending. It should entail obtaining two artifacts: one in the outer ring and one in the middle ring. It should become fairly obvious as a questline to pursue as the player becomes fairly engaged with the game. It is a temptation, and also an alternative to total destruction that the player may take as a failsafe.

# Instruction

Describe 2 incidental artifacts that can be found in the inner ring, and their locations. These are meant to bring power or knowledge to the player, but aren't vital to any one specific plotline. 

Unlike key plot artifacts, these artifacts can take inspiration from the environments in which they are found.

Consider how these artifacts might enhance one or more approaches to gameplay, including: violence, wisdom, diplomacy, wayfinding, protection, intuition, survival, etc.

Make one artifact primarily about enhancing the player's power (an artifact from the tree of life), and one about enhancing knowledge (artifact from the tree of knowledge.)

Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

# Instruction


Describe 6 incidental artifacts that can be found in the middle ring, and their locations. These are meant to bring power or knowledge to the player, but aren't vital to any one specific plotline. 

Unlike key plot artifacts, these artifacts can take inspiration from the environments in which they are found.

Consider how these artifacts might enhance one or more approaches to gameplay, including: violence, wisdom, diplomacy, wayfinding, protection, intuition, survival, etc.

By default it seems that this LLM tends to generate more non-physical, non-violence based artifacts, so consider making at least some (perhaps two) artifacts embody a physical / violent / 'action'-based approach. Similarly, it seems to create pathfinding artifacts (showing safe ways, revealing hidden things, etc.) with too high of a frequency. Make only one artifact related to this theme. Also make at least one artifact convey knowledge of some kind (revealing a certain type of plot information, world lore, etc. This artifact would be from the tree of knowledge)

Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

# Instruction

Describe 9 incidental artifacts that can be found in the outer ring, and their locations. 

Unlike key plot artifacts, these artifacts can take inspiration from the environments in which they are found.

These are meant to bring power or knowledge to the player, but aren't vital to any one specific plotline. Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance. 

Consider how these artifacts might enhance one or more approaches to gameplay, including: violence, wisdom, diplomacy, wayfinding, protection, intuition, survival, etc.

By default it seems that this LLM tends to generate more non-physical, non-violence based artifacts, so consider making at least some (perhaps 3) artifacts embody a physical / violent / 'action'-based approach. Similarly, it seems to create pathfinding artifacts (showing safe ways, revealing hidden things, etc.) with too high of a frequency. Make only one artifact related to this theme. Also make at least one artifact convey knowledge of some kind (revealing a certain type of plot information, world lore, etc. This artifact is from the tree of knowledge)

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

# Instruction (omit result later)

Generate five potential minor artifacts (likely obtained from the outer ring) available for the player to choose from at the beginning of the game. These artifacts should represent an interesting choice for how the player will approach fulfilling their mission (although their minor power implies that they will overly or strongly determine the player's approach. We still want them to essentially have freedom to approach arbitrary situations as they see fit). Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance. Possible thematic approaches include: violence, wisdom, diplomacy, wayfinding, protection, intuition, survival, etc.

In describing the artifacts, make sure to number each one explicitly, for our subsequent choosing process.

By default it seems that this LLM tends to generate more non-physical, non-violence based artifacts, so consider making at least some artifacts (perhaps 2 of the five) embody a physical / violent / 'action'-based approach. 

# Instruction


I choose the following artifacts to be available to the player: <<<5>>> and <<<5>>>

Note: If the numbers above are duplicates, treat that as meaning that only one artifact choice is available to the player.

Describe these artifacts in more detail.

This information will be preserved in the final record, and is canonical (barring any inconsistencies identified and corrected later.)

We will now begin to describe each individual zone in detail, incorporate all information relevant to a zone and its contents into a canonical description of the zone. All prior descriptions of the zones will be discarded, so any significant details you wish to be preserved should be repeated here.

Information on factions, characters, and artifacts will continue to be preserved in their prior canonical form, so you do not need to reproduce that information here, however you should reference the fact that they exist in the zone for purposes of using this record as canonical with respect to the zone itself and its contents.

We will not perform this operation yet: this is merely to confirm that you understand. Do you understand?

# Instruction
