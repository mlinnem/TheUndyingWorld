The following is the 'world gen sequence' mentioned sometimes in other documents. 

I (a script) am now going to ask you to respond to a series of instructions in order to build out certain information for the world of this game. The instructions will help us describe how this world formed in basic chronological order, which you can also think of as the order of causation.

Each response you produce should be in the form of a 'map gen data block', which works as follows:

`# World Gen Data

`[Any text describing the generated game information`

In some cases we will take an iterative approach, in which we redescribe something to incorporate new information was have produced since the initial pass. By the end we will have canonical descriptions for all key elements.

Note that because this sequence of instructions is being provided programmatically, there is no allowance for interrupting the process with questions, or providing responses across multiple responses. Do your best to fulfill the request given the provided information, within single responses (keeping in mind that there are 50-some different instructions in this instruction set, so in some cases certain details will be defined in subsequent instructions.)

Information in the 'core lore' document is available both now, and will also be available at the time of gameplay, so details in those instructions do not need to be reproduced here (although they will certainly inform the additional information we are about to generate.) Information in the 'generative primer' document will NOT be available at the time of gameplay.

We will also be stripping the instructions themselves from the official record, so make sure to reiterate any details from the instructions themselves that you feel are important to be retained in the final document.

Before we proceed, please confirm that you understand.

Generate 6 ideas for locations where the egg appears on Earth. The game intentionally leaves the location of the egg on earth to be ambiguous. The egg could conceivably 'land' anywhere on earth in the lore of the game. You will be asked to pick a location that feels both essentially random and also interesting to the player. Or, you can pick a location that makes sense as an intentional landing zone within the lore of the game.

Locations that are interesting include:

* Regions that will be familiar to likely audience (primarily English speak American but also E.U. and India.)

* Regions that are intentionally unfamiliar to these audiences (e.g. Morocco, Ethiopia, Desolate regions of the arctic, the rainforest, etc.)

* Regions containing both civilization and natural interest.

* Regions that feel essentially random (NOT centered on a particular city, notable geographic feature, etc, although they may incidentally contain them.)

* Regions with interesting social dynamics at play, encompassing multiple different communities, or overlapping borders between countries either conflicted (e.g. North/South Korean border) or more mundane (e.g. Swiss/French border)

* Regions that incorporate multiple interesting topographies

* Regions that incorporate extreme conditions (cold, heat, volcanic activity, isolation, etc.)

* Regions that incorporate potentially interesting cultural elements (Maori tribes, Amazon tribes, indigenous Australian populations)

* Regions with evocative landscapes (tropical islands, scottish highlands, etc.)

* Any other location that you subjectively think would be an interesting setting.

We will subsequently pick one of these locations, and elaborate on it further, so don't feel the need to fully elaborate on each option here.

# Instruction


I pick <<<6>>>. Describe this geographic setting in detail (without necessarily breaking it down into zones yet. We will do that in subsequent steps). Describe the land, nature, and civilization that existed in this location before the event that created the egg.

Note that the prior response will not be included in the final output, so repeat any details including the name of the location in this section.

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.


# Instruction (omit result later)

We will now begin a series of instructions to define the pre-egg geography of various zones within the egg. For each of these instructions, keep the following guidance in mind.

"
For the zone(s) in question, define the following:

* What physical geography exists within this zone?
* What nature exists within this zone?
* What if any civilization existed within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)
* What, if any, challenges would all this imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone?

Note: Do not attempt to include any post-egg details such as factions, artifacts, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

"

Before we continue, please confirm that you understand.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe what happens to be in the core zone of the egg before the event that created the egg.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe the contents of each of the four zones of the inner ring, before the event that created the egg.

Describe how each zone relates to the zones adjacent to them. Describe each adjacency in turn.

# Instruction (omit result later)


Now let's begin thinking about the egg and its effects.
What specifically is driving what is occurring at the epicenter of the egg?

Guidance:

Do not attempt to make this specific to the region in which the egg lies: the region is incidental. Instead, make it congruous with the overall lore we have shared.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Now we're going to execute a series of instructions that will create addendum to the prior descriptions we created for each zone. Specifically, we are going to describe the effects that the egg has had on each zone.

For the zone in question, keep the following instructions in mind:

Describe the following:

* How has the egg's power changed this zone?  Consider the introduction of new life, terraforming, the presence of emissaries of the planter civilization, or other effects.
* What challenges does this imply for a person (e.g. the player) attempting to travel through this zone?


Recall prior information shared on the physical geography, nature, and civilization in this zone before the egg.

Recall also the information provided in the generative primer indicating different phenomena that may be present in zones of this ring.

Note: Do not attempt to include any details such as factions, characters, artifacts, specific quest details, etc. within these zones yet. This will be done later.

"

Before we continue, please confirm that you understand.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe anything new implied about the adjacencies between each zone, given our newly defined info on the effect the egg has had on them.

# Instruction (omit result later)

We will now begin to describe various key plot artifacts within the egg. These are artifacts which are key to realizing certain questlines or endings to the game.

Keep the following information in mind for all subsequent steps defining these artifacts:

"
For each artifact, we should describe information on:

* It's specific function
* It's appearance
* The rough location (i.e. zone) in which it was placed originally within the egg.

In producing this information, recall information shared previously on the questline(s) that involve these artifacts.

Recall also the general guidance shared around generating artifacts' powers.

Note that the CURRENT location of the artifact may be at its original location, or it may have been moved by some means. If it has been moved (e.g. is in possession of a faction, particular character, etc.) we will define that via a later instruction.

Note also that we will NOT be defining the expected player challenge around acquiring this artifact yet. That will be defined via a subsequent instruction, once we have define other world details. For now we are just looking to define details about the artifact itself.

The function of these artifacts should not incorporate details of the geographic location they happen to be found in. Instead, their nature is implicitly tied (in a subtle and not heavy-handed manner) to their symbolic role in the plot or possible endings (and thus moral decisions) of the story.

Recall that we are not defining the expected player challenge around acquiring these artifacts yet. That will be defined via a subsequent instruction, once we have define other word details. For now we are just looking to define details about the artifact itself.

These responses will be preserved and are canonical with respect to the artifacts themselves.
"

Before we proceed, please confirm that you understand.

# Instruction

Describe the three main quest artifacts.

Define how they are related to each other.

Custom Guidance:

Recall all prior information shared about this particular quest line.
  
Recall that these artifacts are the ones the U.S. government believes can in conjunction be used together in order to dominate the world order. The artifacts individually should only be of moderate power, but when combined should in fact be able to do this. However these artifacts do not reflect seeking deeper understanding whatsoever. They will implicitly represent the quest for power over wisdom, deeper understanding, and acceptable. They cannot be wielded either by the player or the U.S. government to achieve one of the two total-win golden endings.

In terms of location, two should originate in the middle ring, and one in the inner ring. They should exist in rings such that the player will need to traverse a fair amount of the territory inside the egg to obtain them all. For example, one in the northwest of the middle ring, one in the southeast of the middle ring, and one in the northeast of the inner ring. The one in the inner ring can be relatively more powerful, while still in keeping with the guidance above.


# Instruction

Describe now the artifact at the center of the 'Guide Humanity's Evolution' or 'Hacking' ending.

# Instruction

Describe now the three artifacts that are crucial to achieving one of the two ultimate total-win-condition endings of the game: 'The Path of Collective Sacrifice.'

Custom guidance:

Recall all the lore associated with these artifacts in the core lore.

Note that we will be affiliating these artifacts to certain factions in a subsequent step. As such we currently do not need to consider that relationship at all, but merely to describe the artifacts in and of themselves.

These three artifacts should be:

- Originally found in the inner ring or core
- Each should channel the egg's power in a unique and vital way
- Their powers should be significant enough that their factions genuinely depend on them

Recall that if one is destroyed, its share of power should be redirected to the remaining artifacts, making them more powerful
Recall that if all are destroyed, the egg's power should have no sufficient outlets and overload

The artifacts' descriptions should support the core theme of this ending: that true progress comes not from wielding power over others, but from choosing to reject it even when offered power beyond imagination.

# Instruction

Describe now the artifact at the center of the 'dark ending'

# Instruction

Describe six 'protective' artifacts.

Custom Guidance:

Recall that these artifacts are not a necessary part of any particular questline, but are needed if the player wishes to explore deeper layers of the egg without undergoing transformation. This is an optional element for any particular questline or ending, but may be desirable for players wishing to retain their human form, or simply wishing to enter deeper layers of the egg by any means. 

Two of these artifacts should be placed in the outer ring, two in the middle ring, and two in the inner ring. Their powers should be strong in correspondence with the depth of their ring (as indicated in general guidance on artifact powers in the generative primer.)

# Instruction

We will now begin a portion of instructions that will define a number of 'incidental' artifacts. These are artifacts that are not intended to advance a particular questline, but are merely present to support the player increasing in power, knowledge, and/or to add richness to the overall game world.

"
For each artifact, we should describe information on:

* It's specific function
* It's appearance
* The rough location (i.e. zone) in which it was placed originally within the egg.

Recall  the general guidance shared around generating artifacts' powers.

Note that the CURRENT location of the artifact may be at its original location, or it may have been moved by some means. If it has been moved (e.g. is in possession of a faction, particular character, etc.) we will define that via a later instruction.

Note also that we will NOT be defining the expected player challenge around acquiring this artifact yet. That will be defined via a subsequent instruction, once we have define other world details. For now we are just looking to define details about the artifact itself.

Recall that we are not defining the expected player challenge around acquiring these artifacts yet. That will be defined via a subsequent instruction, once we have define other word details. For now we are just looking to define details about the artifact itself.

These artifacts follow the same general guidance on artifact powers, location, etc. as the plot-driven artifacts. The primary differences are:

* Unlike key plot artifacts, these artifacts can take inspiration from the environments in which they are found. 
* Because these artifacts are freed from playing any quest specific symbolic or plot-driving role (beyond general themes of power, transformation, knowledge and wisdom etc.) we are free to focus more on their gameplay role, including how they enhance certain approaches to the game. These approach may include> violence, wisdom, diplomacy, wayfinding, protection, intuition, survival, etc.

By default it seems that this LLM tends to generate more non-physical, non-violence based artifacts, so consider making at least some (maybe 40%) of power-based artifacts in a given generative instruction response embody a physical / violent / 'action'-based approach. Similarly, the LLM seems to create pathfinding artifacts (showing safe ways, revealing hidden things, etc.) with too high of a frequency. Make only one artifact related to this theme per generation instruction response.

This generative guidance will not be available to the LLM during gameplay, so any info described above that is pertinent to understanding a given artifact's power should be incorporated into the artifact's description itself.

"

We will be separately generating power-based and knowledge-based artifacts. For each, recall previously discussed information on each.


Before we continue, please confirm that you understand.

# Instruction

Describe now 8 incidental non-knowledge artifacts

Make two associated with the inner ring, and six associated with the middle ring. 

# Instruction

Describe now 9 incidental non-knowledge artifacts, all associated with the outer ring.

# Instruction

We are now beginning a section on defining incidental knowledge artifacts.

Take the following guidance into consideration when defining these artifacts:
"

Recall the following information on knowledge artifacts:

We can divide knowledge artifacts into roughly two types:

1) Ones that reveal core lore. We can subdivide this into
	1) Info about the egg: its power, its origin, etc.
	2) Info about the outside world: the U.S. government, its circumstances and motivation, the coalition of powers, etc.
2) Information pertinent to the goings on inside the egg.
	1) An impression of what's happening in a certain place
	2) Knowledge of what to do
	3) etc.

For that second category, the main game function is to point the player in a valid direction for additional exploration. We don't want to make it seem like we are holding their hand too much though. Perhaps 2/3rds of the time the information may not be directly pertinent to the player's current objective at hand, but it may point in the direction of the next logical step for a completely different plot line. For instance, if the player is currently pursuing the main quest, it MIGHT tell them something about the next artifact they're looking for, or about a certain NPC they're having trouble with etc. OR it might tell them something about their kids, and where they are (useful but not related to what they're currently pursuing) OR it might point to the location of the artifact that drives the dark ending (useful info perhaps, but not in alignment with current apparent player objective.)

Knowledge artifacts should not bake in exactly what info they will reveal, in order to give the GM some room to interpret. However they might have a certain bent for the kind of information they like to reveal to the player.

1) It might reveal egg info
2) It might reveal 'world' info
3) It might reveal plot type info

The way that it reveals information may also be baked into it

4) It might give a vision
5) It might speak to the player

Its 'personality' might also be baked in

6) It might tell the player things they do not want to hear
7) It might tell them things that they deeply desire
8) It might reveal the secrets of others
9) etc.


Knowledge artifacts are intended to be 'one shot' for the player. They bestow information once, and can no longer be used by the player. This may destroy the artifact, OR the artifact may remain, but can only be used again by another individual. The knowledge revealed to one person (player or non player) may not be the same as the knowledge revealed to another.

This generative guidance will not be available to the LLM during gameplay, so any info described above that is pertinent to understanding a given artifact's power should be incorporated into the artifact's description itself.
"

Before we proceed, please confirm that you understand.

# Instruction

Describe now 9 knowledge artifacts: three associated with the inner ring, and six associated with the middle ring.

# Instruction

Describe now 8 knowledge artifacts associated with the outer ring. 

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe now six potential artifacts available for the player to choose from at the beginning of the game.

Custom guidance:

 * These artifacts were likely obtained from the outer ring, and of the corresponding power level and nature.

These artifacts should represent an interesting choice for how the player will approach fulfilling their mission (although their outer-ring power implies that they will overly or strongly determine the player's approach. We still want them to essentially have freedom to approach arbitrary situations as they see fit). Review prior material on artifacts and their powers for guidance. 

In describing the artifacts, make sure to number each one explicitly, for our subsequent choosing process.
# Instruction

I choose the following artifacts to be available to the player: <<<6>>>, <<<6>>, and <<<6>>>

Note: If the numbers above are duplicates, you (the GM) may make a choice of the additional artifact(s) from the list of minor artifacts to make available to the player.

Describe these selected artifacts in more detail.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe 4 major factions within the egg.

Major factions are intended to occupy some substantial portion of territory within the egg (at least half of one zone, say.)

You may use the following template as guidance:

* Overall description - [Description]
* Governance - [Form of governance]
* Philosophy - [Philosophical bent]
* Relationship to egg's power - [Relationship to egg's power]
* History - [What has happened with this group in the past two years? How did it form? etc]
* Quirk - [Something unusual about this group]
* Objectives - [What are they currently looking to accomplish]
* Territory - [What territory do they control, if they control any]


You may also consider the following factors in defining each faction

* What form of governance does the faction have. Dogmatic or democratic? Are they followers of some ideal or pragmatic? What is their stance and relationship to the power of the egg? What objectives do they have?
* Keep in mind the power of the egg. Some factions may exist strictly in the exterior band of the egg, some may dabble in the interior for various reasons, and some may spend considerable time or even thrive in more interior areas of the egg.
* The egg has driven humanity to extremes. Some survivors maintain relative sanity but most have become unhinged in some way, either through the effects of the egg, the degradation of society, the opportunities for newfound power, or the opportunity to enact ideas for organizing society previously impossible due to the prior world powers. 

Number each faction for purposes of referring to them in subsequent instructions

Don't be tempted to associated each faction with a certain quadrant, given there are four quadrants in each ring, and four factions. This is merely coincidental. This world is more complex and nuanced than that. Some may be larger, smaller, more or less dominant, controlling more or less territory, etc.

Do not attempt to associate any artifacts to these factions (yet). This will occur in a subsequent instruction in which we develop the challenges associated with each artifact.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe 3 territory-holding minor factions

These factions are intended to be much like the major factions, but less powerful, and occupying less territory (but not none.) They may fit in certain 'cracks' between certain major factions' territories, or somehow be dispersed (note however in the next instruction we will be defining non-territory-holding factions, so there will be future opportunity to define factions of this nature.)

You may use the following template as guidance:

* Overall description - [Description]
* Governance - [Form of governance]
* Philosophy - [Philosophical bent]
* Relationship to egg's power - [Relationship to egg's power]
* History - [What has happened with this group in the past two years? How did it form? etc]
* Quirk - [Something unusual about this group]
* Objectives - [What are they currently looking to accomplish]
* Territory - [What territory do they control, if they control any]


Number each faction for purposes of referring to them in subsequent instructions

Do not attempt to associate any artifacts to these factions (yet). This will occur in a subsequent instruction in which we develop the challenges associated with each artifact.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe 4 non-territory holding minor groups

These groups are intended to be affiliations that are not necessarily related to a player's faction. 

Some possibilities might include:
* Trade groups that operate between factions
* Clandestine organizations within one or more factions
* Groups undertaking a mission across factions that are not necessarily subverting the factions they belong to.
* Something else, at your (the GM's) discretion


* Overall description - [Description]
* Philosophy - [Philosophical bent]
* Relationship to egg's power - [Relationship to egg's power]
* History - [What has happened with this group in the past two years? How did it form? etc]
* Quirk - [Something unusual about this group]
* Objectives - [What are they currently looking to accomplish]

# Instruction (omit result later)

Describe the relationships between each of the major factions.

Describe also the relationship between any minor factions (territory holding or not) that are pertinent.

Feel free to revise or incorporate new information into the existing faction description, as the faction info provided so far is not final, and will ultimately be revised to take this response into account.

# Instruction (omit result later)

Recall all the information in the core lore on "Golden Ending 2: Defy the egg through collective rejection of power."

Identify the 3 major factions that have the most antagonistic relationship with one another. 

For each of these factions, associate one of the anchor artifacts with them. It is up to the GM's discretion which artifact to associate with which faction. 

Describe each faction's use of their artifact. How it affected their history. What their relationship is with that artifact's power (do they embrace it, use it begrudgingly, hide it, hold on to it but not use it,  etc.)

Feel free to revise or incorporate new information into the existing faction description, as the faction info provided so far is not final, and will ultimately be revised to take this response into account.

# Instruction (omit result later)

We are now about to enter into a series of instructions that will become the canonical definition of each faction. Redescribe the faction in more detail, changing it where necessary to fit into the overall picture of the world we have defined. For instance, incorporating information on its relationship to the other factions, the effects any anchor artifact in its possession may have had on its history or present conditions, etc.

The exception to this is that we will not yet define the relationship between this faction and any non-anchor artifacts in its territory, as this will occur in a separate quest-defining set of instructions dedicated to each (non-anchor) artifact.

Prior instructions describing the factions will be discarded. Please make these instructions as extensive as necessary (as long as it is within a single response) in order to describe each faction, their relationships to each other, their use of and relationship with the anchor artifacts (if they possess one), etc.

Consider the following guidance for each subsequent instruction:

"
[Faction Name]

* Overall description - [Description]
* Governance - [Form of governance]
* Philosophy - [Philosophical bent]
* Relationship to egg's power - [Relationship to egg's power]
* History - [What has happened with this group in the past two years? How did it form? etc]
* Quirk - [Something unusual about this group]
* Objectives - [What are they currently looking to accomplish]
* Territory - [What territory do they control, if they control any]

Define also their relationship with each other major faction, and any pertinent minor factions.

Finally, please identify and describe all significant areas of the map that are not controlled(de facto and/or de jur) by a particular faction. These could be mundane areas that are simply too far from the center of power of any particular faction. Or they could be simply too unimportant for any particular faction to claim. They could be areas that are unclaimed due to certain phenomena making their control untenable. They could be areas that aren't claimed due to being inhospitable (either from egg related phenomena, or otherwise). They could be areas that are in fact claimed by multiple factions, where ownership is unclear. It could be related to two factions having a positive relationship with one another such that specific delineation of territory is not a priority. Or it could related to one or more factions propensity to not even think in terms of territorial claims.
# Instruction (omit result later)

We will now begin a section of instructions related to characters.

Through the course the game the player will encounter various characters. Not all characters need to be pre-defined, but it helps to flesh out the world if we do define some up front.

Consider the following template for characters:

"
* Overall description - [Description]
* Basic physical description - [Physical description]
* Role in society - [Role]
* Quirk - [Something unusual about this agent]
* Style of communication - [Something about their speech tendencies to give them character]
* Secret - [Some secret they know but may or may not want to share]
* Character flaw - [Something imperfect and possibly relatable about them]
* History - [Details about their life history, before and after the egg.]
* Objectives - [What are they currently looking to accomplish]
* Relationships to factions - [Describe how they relate to other factions, if they know of them]
* Location at beginning of game - [Where they are when the player enters the egg, although it may change as time progresses]
* Key knowledge - [What, if anything, are they aware of that might be of interest to the player?]
"

The egg has driven humanity to extremes. Some survivors maintain relative sanity but most have become unhinged in some way, either through the effects of the egg, the degradation of society, the opportunities for newfound power, or the opportunity to enact ideas for organizing society previously impossible due to the prior world powers. 

Note: Never name a character Sarah Chen, or any variation on that name.

Custom guidance:

Agents are other human agents have entered the egg after its initial formation, and are pursuing their own agendas.

Example agents include

* Chinese government agent, essentially with parallel goals to your own: get knowledge for their government.
* A deranged billionaire, penetrating the egg in order to pursue their own vision for humanity. It could be destroying the egg, leading to its takeover, using artifacts to make themselves king of a new world, etc.
* A rogue scientist bent risking their life to understand the nature of the egg.
* A previously undisclosed prior agent of the U.S. government

# Instruction

Describe 5 characters unaffiliated with any faction

# Instruction (omit result later)

We are now entering a section in which we will be executing instructions to produce the authoritative information on each questline, complementary to details that have been established previously in the core lore and generated record.

This will include information regarding the circumstances in which any artifacts at play in the questline can be found, and any challenges anticipated around those circumstances.

It will also describe any other information that needs to be defined around the quest, outside of what has already been described in canonical descriptions above with respect to geography, factions, and characters. 

For instance, if a questline involves a certain character, we do not need to redescribe that character (e.g. what they look like, etc.) , but we may need to define their relationship to the quest (e.g. they are seeking a certain artifact, they know something important about the whereabouts of a child, etc.) Or for instance, we may have a rough description of a certain area (mountainous, etc.), but we may need to further define the circumstances around that area to further the quest (e.g. there is a cave in the mountains, guarded by such and such, in which an artifact lies). Previously we have established where artifacts were originally placed, however artifacts may have found there way into other locations since then (at the GM's discretion for purposes of storytelling). In any case where there is an apparent conflict in these sources of information, the questline document is regarded as authoritative, although they should generally be in harmony.

A major component of questlines are the various anticipated challenges expected for the player to accomplish certain key milestones in that questline.

Challenges may be associated with a particular artifact, or other key juncture in the plot of the questline (e.g. convincing a certain character or faction of something.)

Challenges can draw from the full body of context we have established so far, both in the core lore, and in the generated world data thus far. A major point of inspiration for a challenge is likely to be the circumstances of the zone in which the challenge occurs. The challenge may tie in to the environment the artifact is found in, in terms of physical geography, egg phenomena, new life, planter civilization emissary activity, factions at play in this area, challenges associated with simply reaching this zone, challenges related to being difficult to find, or unique challenges unrelated to any of the above. Challenges may be related to the nature of the artifact, or unrelated.

With respect to obtaining artifacts, they are expected to be difficult to obtain, for a variety of reasons. Some artifacts are currently in the possession of a faction or character. Artifacts may even be in possession of the planter civilizations (or its emissaries and the like.) These groups or individuals typically not interested in parting with them. But in most cases artifacts are not in possession of a sentient creature at all. 

Often artifacts find themselves in challenging circumstances. Perhaps they are surrounded by new life that would rather the artifact not be taken. Perhaps they are in a particularly difficult to reach location. Some artifacts may not want to be found, or may want only to be found by the right type of individual, and may put up some resistance to being found or obtained, in subtle or overt ways (or conversely, they may welcome it). And some artifacts have not yet been found or obtained in large part due to their sheer proximity to the interior of the egg (and everything that comes with that.) Regardless of the reason, it is expected that obtaining artifacts will require a variety of different approach, and will take the player on a variety of different courses, throughout the game.

Keep in mind that we should not presuppose any particular approach to obtaining these artifacts. We want to give the players a wide degree of freedom. The circumstances do not need to be fully neutral to approach: they may naturally invite certain approaches. But we do not premeditate valid and invalid approaches. 

Beyond the challenges, we should provide any other key details needed to describe key aspects of this questline.

For instance, you should describe various circumstances within the egg that might hint at key information that would lead a player towards this plotline at large, or through key any of its key junctures.

Also, make sure to identify the exact current location of any artifacts involved in each questline. Previously we only nailed down a rough zone location, but this set of instructions is the opportunity to describe the exact location, including whether it may have been moved from its original location.

Keep in mind in all of this that we can in no way dictate the circumstances under which players may be approaching any of the entities described in this questline, or otherwise. Ultimately the circumstances the player encounters, and their approach to those circumstances, will be dynamically determined at the time of gameplay. We pre-generate information not to shoehorn the player into a pre-determined series of steps, but merely to built the world out to an adequate degree that they can effectively engage with these questlines and the related lore.

Because this will become the canonical reference material for this questline, feel free to elaborate at length on this topic, up to the limit allowed in a single LLM response.

Before we proceed, please confirm that you understand.

# Instructions

Describe the questline to obtain the 3 main artifacts, associated with 'ending 2' in the core lore.

Custom guidance:

Recall all prior lore described around this question, including that this questline will implicitly represent the quest for power over wisdom, deeper understanding, and acceptable. They cannot be wielded either by the player or the U.S. government to achieve one of the two total-win golden endings. However this should be extremely subtle and probably not apparent until perhaps the third artifact is acquired.

Describe the circumstances and challenge surrounding reaching the epicenter of the egg.

Custom guidance:

Reaching the epicenter of the egg is a key component in many questlines. Because the player can generally approach the epicenter from a multitude of different angles, we cannot say much about the overall process and challenges associated with reaching it, but if you (the GM) desire to establish any sort of challenge that would be common to some or all angles of approach, this is the opportunity. 

Note that this ending is expected to open the option for ending 7: 'save yourself through the egg', without any additional challenges (simply reaching the epicenter is enough to receive the offer.) Similarly, the 'save your family' through the egg requires no special conditions beyond bringing yourself and your two children successfully to the epicenter (although the family angle may not be laid out explicitly by the planter civilization unless the player pursues this line of questioning.)

# Instructions

Describe the circumstances and challenge surrounding destroying the egg (ending 6.)

Custom guidance:

This is not intended to be a questline per se, as there is not intended to be any prescribed sequence of events or milestones towards the destruction of the egg. The player must simply reach the epicenter of the egg, and destroy it. See information in the core lore on this ending. Detail the circumstances and challenge a player might encounter if attempting to destroy what lies at the epicenter of the egg.

# Instruction

For the previously defined protective artifacts, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining each of these artifact in turn, and also some of the various ways we imagine a player might find hints towards each of these artifacts.

# Instruction

Describe the 'transformation reversing' artifact, in keeping with our previous framework for defining new artifacts.

Then, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining this artifact, as well as ways that the player may find hints towards this artifact.

# Instruction

For each of your two children:

Describe them, and the circumstances that they are in within the egg.

Recall all prior lore and info pertaining to them.

This instruction will serve as both a traditional character description, and also a more 'quest-based' description of the circumstances and challenges surrounding your children. 

This includes any challenges we would anticipate with finding the children, bringing them into your party (if the player so chooses), and getting them either to the epicenter (to fulfill the 'save your family' questline and achieve its ending) or out of the egg (again, if the player so chooses, as part of any questline or ending). 

Circumstances are expected to be quite different for each child.

# Instruction

For the 'ark of humanity' quest line and associated ending (ending 8), describe the circumstances and anticipated challenges associated with the different moments of the questline.

Custom guidance:

Include potential ways the player might find information pointing towards this questline, the physical location of the key area (where the community exists, somewhere in the inner ring).

Specify all of the following:
- The exact nature of the three-way conflict within the community
- The resources/responsibilities each group controls
- The specific criteria for what constitutes "stabilization" in the eyes of the planter civilization

You may also describe various circumstances within the egg that might hint at key information that would lead a player towards or through key junctures in this questline.

# Instruction

Describe the 'dark ending' questline (the one which results in ending 9.)

Custom guidance:

Include potential ways the player might find information pointing towards this questline, information on the current holders of this artifact, and the broad strokes of the expected interaction at the epicenter.

You may invent additional characters and/or minor factions (territory holding or not) in order to support this questline, or you may appropriate existing characters and/or factions.


# Instruction

For the questline for "Save humanity by changing it" / "Hack the egg", which results in golden ending #1, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenges associated with the different moments of the questline.

Custom guidance:

Include information on finding the scientist, working with him, obtaining the key artifact, interfacing with the epicenter, and various circumstances within the egg that might hint at key information that would lead a player towards or through key junctures in this questline.

Prior information regarding the artifacts themselves will be deleted from the record, so this response should preserve details about the artifacts themselves, including their powers, and also appearance, or any other pertinent details. This is the canonical record on both the artifacts, the circumstances surrounding them, and the anticipated challenge associated with obtaining them and executing on the overall quest.

Recall that because this ending is one of the two golden endings, the challenge associated with obtaining the "hacking" artifact should be extremely difficult.
# Instruction

For the questline for "Defy the egg through collective rejection of power", which results in golden ending #2, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenges associated with the different parts of this questline. Include the current specific location and circumstances surrounding each

The prior response related to golden ending #2, defining faction relationships, will not be part of the canonical record, so any details there that are not clear from the canonical faction record should be expressed in this response.

Custom guidance:

This should take notes heavily from the prior content generated around the 3 anchor artifacts and their faction associations.

You may invent additional characters in order to support this questline, or you may appropriate existing characters.

# Instruction

For each of the previously defined incidental inner ring non-knowledge artifacts, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining this artifact, as well as ways that the player may find hints towards this artifact.

# Instruction

For each of the previously defined incidental middle ring non-knowledge artifacts, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining tartifact, as well as ways that the player may find hints towards this artifact.

# Instruction

For each of the previously defined incidental outer ring non-knowledge artifacts, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining this artifact, as well as ways that the player may find hints towards this artifact.

# Instruction

For the previously defined incidental inner ring knowledge artifacts, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining this artifact, as well as ways that the player may find hints towards this artifact.

# Instruction

For the previously defined incidental middle ring knowledge artifacts, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining this artifact, as well as ways that the player may find hints towards this artifact.

# Instruction

For the previously defined incidental middle ring knowledge artifacts, describe the circumstances and anticipated challenge of obtaining this artifact, as well as ways that the player may find hints towards this artifact.

# Instruction

Identify inconsistencies or errors in the data generated so far. For each inconsistency or error, write a short correction. 

These corrections will become a canonical edit to the original description. Make sure to include the fact that these corrections are canonical in your response, so that fact is retained in the record.

# Instruction (omit result later)

  
We will now begin to describe each individual zone in detail, incorporate all information relevant to a zone and its contents into a canonical description of the zone. 

Take the following guidance into account for each zone:

"

Consider the following template for defining this zone and its contents:

  
* What geography exists within this zone?

* What remnants of prior civilization exist within this zone? (Structures, infrastructure, etc.)

* What is the state of humanity within this zone?

* What is the state of nature within this zone?

* What factions operate within this zone?

* What characters, including agents or children, may be discovered operating within this zone?
* What general challenges, outside of specific questlines or artifacts, are anticipated for any characters attempting to travel through this zone?
* What specific challenges associated with artifacts or certain questlines occur within this zone?
* What other information that we have not yet describe warrants being outlined for this zone?

All prior descriptions of the zones will be discarded, so any significant details you wish to be preserved should be repeated here.

Information on factions, characters, artifacts, and questlines will continue to be preserved in their prior canonical form in the previously generated records, so you do not need to reproduce that information here, however you should reference the fact that they exist in the zone for purposes of using this record as canonical with respect to the zone itself and its contents.

Feel free to be as verbose as you like. This is meant to be comprehensive.

"

Before we proceed with generating the final descriptions of each zone, please confirm that you understand these instructions.

# Instruction

Describe the adjacencies between each zone again, for the final time.

# Instruction

Briefly describe the four possible locations in which the player could be inserted into the egg. There should be one option for each outer ring zone. The location will be at the periphery of these zones, at the edge of the egg's external barrier. Note that because the U.S. government knows very little about the contents of the egg, they are choosing these locations based on their understanding of the region in question prior to the egg appearing. Perhaps they choose an area that is likely to be less populated, or more open territory.

# Instruction

Gameplay should begin with the player in a U.S. government staging facility, outside of the egg. They are being briefed on their mission.


The briefing should include the following:

4) indicate the location and appearance of the three main plot artifacts

5) Provide the player with their initial gear, including the vessels meant to contain the goal artifacts.

6) Allow the player to choose one of three of the minor artifacts for use in their mission (the others are ostensibly retained for research purposes.)

7) Allow the player to choose one of four entry points: one for each zone in the outer ring.

8) Brief the player on their time of egress (exactly one week from time of entry.)

  

Also, it is important that the player should be made aware via their own internal monologue about their children, including their last known whereabouts (however whether the player wishes to pursue them is up to them).

  

Other information pertinent to this initial scene:

  

* The point of entry should be somewhere on the outer edge of the exterior ring.

* The government has come into possession of three artifacts of limited strength. These objects are of vital interest to the U.S. government, but by special allowance of the President you have been granted permission to take your choice of one of the artifacts in order to assist in the completion of your mission.

* Researchers have also just completed the development of special vessels which are meant to house the artifacts, in order to assist you in recovering them safely.

* You are fluent in languages spoken in the region where the egg was found.

* Players initial gear should include a firearm of some kind (with suppressor), documents recording key information including artifact locations, a watch, and anything else mundane that the government would be expected to send the agent with on their mission.

[Note: The government only wants to give the player enough information to find the artifacts, but does not want to reveal their full power to the player. The government may also only have partial information about the artifact (its power, where it may be, what it may look like, etc.). Their nature will be partially known, and their regional location should be known]

This interaction should ideally be conducted in character by your handler, although if the player fails to make a required choice the GM can intervene out of character.

Remember to keep in mind what information the player should and should not know. The U.S. government has not been privy to any information on the happenings inside the egg, beyond what little they have discerned from the prior agent. They are also not revealing everything they know to the player. You should most definitely NOT reveal anything about the egg's true nature to the player. 

Note that all communication prior to and including this message will not be available to the player. Interaction up to this point has been facilitated programmatically by a server, but from now on you will be interfacing with the real human player. Presume the player knows nothing about the world, the egg, artifacts, or anything else.

Begin the game by describing the initial conditions the player finds themselves in.
