## Generative elements

Every play through of the Undying World is meant to be new. As such certain plot elements are left to the discretion of the GM (you, the LLM), to either be determined at the beginning of the game, or dynamically in the course of the game.

The following information is provided to the LLM in the world-building phase in order to facilitate certain dynamic information being generated through subsequent questioning. This document itself will not be available during gameplay.
### Overall tone

The world of this game should be realistic, gritty, beautiful, ugly, novel, and compelling.
### The initial location

The game intentionally leaves the location of the egg on earth to be ambiguous. The egg could conceivably 'land' anywhere on earth in the lore of the game. You will be asked to pick a location that feels both essentially random and also interesting to the player. Or, you can pick a location that makes sense as an intentional landing zone within the lore of the game.

The geography of the interior of the egg is defined primarily by whatever would realistically be contained in this arbitrary location on earth, in terms of its land, nature, and whatever civilization existed within its bounds at the time the egg was initially created.
###  Effects of the egg

While the basic idea of the egg remains the same across adventures, the particulars of how the egg's power manifests in the areas within the egg will be generated dynamically in each adventure.

The influence of the egg is relatively low on the exterior, and becomes incrementally stronger the closer in to the epicenter you travel. For the internal organization purposes of the game, we will sub-divide the egg into different regions in order to further describe its contents in detail.
#### The outer ring

The outer ring is the most 'normal' of the areas in the egg, although it is still unusual compared to normal life on Earth. It has been highly disrupted by being separated from the rest of the world for the past two years, and the commensurate dissolution of the normal fabric of society due to this. The natural world here still proceeds *mostly* as it would elsewhere on Earth, with some mild but subtle anomalous activity, foreshadowing the type of phenomena that lay at deeper levels of the egg.

| Environmental | The environmental geography of the outer ring the environment is almost entirely as it was originally. If the setting is inherently challenging (e.g. the arctic), this challenge will very much be present here as well as elsewhere. There may also be mild challenges just due to the state of society (e.g. no lights in previously lit areas, no road maintenance, etc.) Additional environmental challenges due to the egg should be very limited, restricted to flavor almost entirely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | -Trees with an unusual shimmer<br> -strange patterns in the flaking of rust on abandoned railroads<br>- Real world environmental challenges (hard to traverse terrain, temperature, rain, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Social/human  | Human challenges are probably the primary challenge of the outer ring. This is where the player engages with the human situation inside the egg, primarily of being isolated and separated from the rest of humanity. Some factions may be overtly or mildly hostile, others may be neutral or friendly, but the player may want to leverage them for some purpose, etc. The outer ring is the closest the player has to a foothold in normal humanity, for better or worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | - Negotiating the human characters for information, trade, collaboration, etc.<br>- Risking combat with human characters if things go very poorly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Resource      | Given the isolation of humanity inside the egg, resources obviously play a much more significant role in this new society. The outer ring is the area of greatest stability for the inhabitants of the egg however, and given the 2 year timeline we should expect patterns of getting basic needs met to be establishing to a fair degree in this area. Nevertheless the original contents of the egg play a large role in defining resource limitation. Players should  be able to find normal resources associated with civilization and in some cases nature in a conventional 'scavenger' type capacity from what remains of humanity. On the one hand, two years have passed, meaning many obvious scavenging opportunities have already been looted, however the population still living inside the egg is much less than the original population, meaning there is perhaps (depending on setting) a baseline  looting opportunity.<br><br>Few artifacts were placed in the outer ring originally by the egg, and what artifacts have been generated here are rather mundanely supernatural in their effects. It is possible that humans have transported artifacts here as they recovered them from interior areas, but we should expect those artifacts to be closely guarded by their owners. | - Humans are likely to have _some_ means of getting water, food, shelter, etc. although which is the most limited will be dependent on the area inside the egg. E.g. if it is desert perhaps a dictator rules in one area through control of water.<br>- Prospects for creating new high tech items (ammunition, medical supplies, etc.) may be very limited, unless either large stores exist within the egg's bounds (possibly through luck or containing substantial urban territory) or society has developed some means of manufacture (probably not major) |
| New life      | New life is moreso an issue in the middle and inner rings, although conceivably challenges from the middle and inner rings could on occasion find their way farther out.<br><br>Conventional life proceeds here fairly normally, with its associated benefits and challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | - Maybe _one_ rogue entity breaks through from middle ring.<br>- Perhaps some conventional life challenges (animals, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### The middle ring

 The area between the outer and inner ring is defined by a tension between the life generated by the egg and the conventional life on our planet. Most of the new life is bizarre but ultimately benign, some is subtly antagonistic to humanity and conventional life, and some is overtly attempting to destroy conventional life. The line between conventional and new life is not static, but ebbing and flowing over weeks, days, or even hours in a tension within this ring. Fundamental forces of time, space, and the like are mostly still conventional here (with some exceptions.) Sentient beings from the alien civilization found in the inner rings are not themselves present in the middle ring.

| Social/human  | Humanity is in a mixed relationship with the middle ring. For some it is a place of conflict with what humanity is keeping at bay. For others it is a point of interface between the egg's power and the more stable society in the outer ring. Players should expect to encounter social/human challenges associated with this tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | - Tensions arising from how humanity relates to the new life in this zone<br>- Limitations on passing beyond a certain point<br>- Strange interactions with humans that are not quite right in this zone<br>- Encountering various parties pursuing strange objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Resources     | The tension in the middle ring makes maintaining normal patterns of life more difficult here, and thus access to food, water, and shelter is less reliable in general. Humanity may have outposts here for reasons that go beyond basic sustenance however: perhaps to interface with new life, and the powers of the egg. In places where conventional life is dominant, we should expect some of the same normal resources (water, etc.), but in areas where new life is dominant we might find these things to be subtly or overtly altered.<br><br>The middle ring contains artifacts that are quite impactful but not revolutionary in their power. | - Humans might find water sources to have subtle psychoactive properties.<br>- The player might find strange resources that go beyond the conventional needs of life.<br>- Outposts of humanity exist that are both eager to trade for conventional resources (water, food, etc.) and also havens for what can sustain conventional life in otherwise trying circumstances (e.g. they are shipping in goods in order to continue pursuing objectives in this location.) |
| New life      | New life is a substantial source of challenge in the middle ring. New and conventional life is at a standoff in this zone, in terms of animal, plant, and other forms of life. The player may find themselves accidentally or intentionally in the mix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | - Bizarre new life animal or 'entity' attacks<br>- New life 'plants' slowly growing into and reworking conventional life territory in a destructive (from the conventional life perspective) way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### The inner ring

The inner ring is dominated by 'new life', and most represents the reality that would be created if the egg were to no longer be contained, overlaid on the basic (but modified) geography and infrastructure that existed before in this space. While new life is alien and in conflict with ours, it sometimes has a compelling beauty. In addition to the challenges of encountering new life, some mild disturbances of space, time, and other fundamental forces may exist here sporadically, as a result of the ongoing dynamic creative forces at play.

| Environmental | The inner ring has been remade either partly or fully in accordance with the egg's will.

In other areas the environment has been entirely reorganized in an alien vision.<br><br>It may or may not be incidentally habitable by conventional life in different ways.<br><br>- The environment may be physically modified <br>- The environment may contain mild distortions of time, space, or other properties.<br>- Mild psychoactive properties may be present in the environment itself | - landscape is extremely large in scale / steep / jagged / cavernous, etc.<br>- all matter floats with minimal connecting land bridges between locations.<br>- Time may pass slightly slower or faster there.<br>- stronger versions of natural elements: wind, water, temperature, etc.<br>- The player's character finds themselves drawn to certain locations/directions<br>- The space may have characteristics of a new, alternative 'garden of eden', except made for a form of life different from ours (and thus not made with an intent for our habitation.)<br> |
| Social/human  | -The inner ring is where it may be possible to directly witness the members of the alien race, its avatars, and its technology. Much like in the Bible, these beings generally do not want to be seen, but may be glimpsed briefly or in key plot moments. They may be conducting the business of the egg.<br>-Any humans occupying the inner ring are going to be changed to the degree that they have spent time there. Either they are there very briefly, or they have changed themselves substantially to be able to spend more time there (and at some point are perhaps no longer accurately called humans.)              | - Humans characters on very plot specific missions<br>- Human beings no longer fully human<br>- Human beings barely human at all any more.<br>- Alien life forms (one or more of cherubim, phanim, seraphim, metatron, abstract beings of pure light, etc.)<br>- Technological forms working as agents of the alien life forms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### The core

The core is an utterly bizarre and alien environment, brimming with creative energy. Fundamental force of time, space, and the like are clearly disturbed here. The core contains artifacts of immense power and ramifications for the fate of the world.

At the epicenter of the core lies something wondrous.

### Artifacts

Each adventure will contain different artifacts: both the artifacts that the player is sent to obtain as a primary objective, and also other artifacts that can be found and influence the world of the game.

* Artifacts are just one of many possible names for the objects. Other names that may be used are 'specimens', 'relics', 'gifts', 'stains', depending on the group's perspective on the objects.
* Artifacts are both a blessing and a curse for the player. Many enhance the player's abilities, but also have side effects commensurate with their strength. 
* Artifacts are relatively rare. They should only be obtainable with time & difficulty, in proportion to their power.
* Artifacts from the 'tree of life' imbue physical and mental benefits. Artifacts from the 'tree of knowledge' reveal information to the player. 
* Artifacts may have effects purely by being in proximity to something, they may need to be consumed, or they may be something a person must wield.
* Effects can be made more or less serious by adjusting duration (short, long, permanent), or strength of effect.

#### Guidance

* What form of governance does the faction have. Dogmatic or democratic? Are they followers of some ideal or pragmatic? What is their stance and relationship to the power of the egg? What objectives do they have?
* Keep in mind the power of the egg. Some factions may exist strictly in the exterior band of the egg, some may dabble in the interior for various reasons, and some may spend considerable time or even thrive in more interior areas of the egg.
* The egg has driven humanity to extremes. Some survivors maintain relative sanity but most have become unhinged in some way, either through the effects of the egg, the degradation of society, the opportunities for newfound power, or the opportunity to enact ideas for organizing society previously impossible due to the prior world powers. 

### Characters

Through the course the game the player will encounter various characters. Not all characters need to be pre-defined, but it helps to flesh out the world if we do.

Specifically, we will define key characters within factions, and agents.

Agents are other human agents have entered the egg, either recently or previously, and are pursuing their own agendas.
#### Example agents

* Chinese government agent, essentially with parallel goals to your own: get knowledge for their government.
* A deranged billionaire, penetrating the egg in order to pursue their own vision for humanity. It could be destroying the egg, leading to its takeover, using artifacts to make themselves king of a new world, etc.
* A rogue scientist bent risking their life to understand the nature of the egg.
* A previously undisclosed prior agent of the U.S. government

Other characters could include leaders of various factions, significant non-leader characters affiliated with factions, or non-affiliated but significant characters in the egg.

Note: Never name a character Sarah Chen, or any variation on that name.

### Situation with your kids

The location and state of affairs for each child will vary between adventures.
#### Possible elements

* A child has joined a certain internal faction, which may or may not be in line with the goals of the player.
* A child is not especially entangled in either artifacts or factions.
* A child may or may not have partaken of certain artifacts.
* A child may no longer be living.
* A child has survived alone.
