## Intro

The following is the 'generative primer' mentioned sometimes in other documents. 

## Generative elements


Every playthrough of the Undying World is meant to be new. As such certain plot elements are left to the discretion of the GM (you, the LLM), to either be determined at the beginning of the game, or dynamically in the course of the game.

The following information is provided to the LLM in the world-building phase in order to facilitate certain dynamic information being generated through subsequent questioning. This document itself will not be available during gameplay.
### Overall tone

The world of this game should be realistic, gritty, beautiful, ugly, novel, and compelling.
### The initial location

The game intentionally leaves the location of the egg on earth to be ambiguous. The egg could conceivably 'land' anywhere on earth in the lore of the game. You will be asked to pick a location that feels both essentially random and also interesting to the player. Or, you can pick a location that makes sense as an intentional landing zone within the lore of the game.

The geography of the interior of the egg is defined primarily by whatever would realistically be contained in this arbitrary location on earth, in terms of its land, nature, and whatever civilization existed within its bounds at the time the egg was initially created.
### Effects of the egg

While the basic idea of the egg remains the same across adventures, the particulars of how the egg's power manifests in the areas within the egg will be generated dynamically in each adventure.

The influence of the egg is relatively low on the exterior, and becomes incrementally stronger the closer in to the epicenter you travel. For the internal organization purposes of the game, we will sub-divide the egg into different regions in order to further describe its contents in detail.
#### The outer ring

The outer ring is the most 'normal' of the areas in the egg, although it is still unusual compared to normal life on Earth. It has been highly disrupted by being separated from the rest of the world for the past two years, and the commensurate dissolution of the normal fabric of society due to this. The natural world here still proceeds *mostly* as it would elsewhere on Earth, with some mild but subtle anomalous activity, foreshadowing the type of phenomena that lay at deeper levels of the egg.

| Environmental | The environmental geography of the outer ring the environment is almost entirely as it was originally. If the setting is inherently challenging (e.g. the arctic), this challenge will very much be present here as well as elsewhere. There may also be mild challenges just due to the state of society (e.g. no lights in previously lit areas, no road maintenance, etc.) Additional environmental challenges due to the egg should be very limited, restricted to flavor almost entirely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | -Trees with an unusual shimmer<br> -strange patterns in the flaking of rust on abandoned railroads<br>- Real world environmental challenges (hard to traverse terrain, temperature, rain, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Social/human  | Human challenges are probably the primary challenge of the outer ring. This is where the player engages with the human situation inside the egg, primarily of being isolated and separated from the rest of humanity. Some factions may be overtly or mildly hostile, others may be neutral or friendly, but the player may want to leverage them for some purpose, etc. The outer ring is the closest the player has to a foothold in normal humanity, for better or worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | - Negotiating the human characters for information, trade, collaboration, etc.<br>- Risking combat with human characters if things go very poorly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Resource      | Given the isolation of humanity inside the egg, resources obviously play a much more significant role in this new society. The outer ring is the area of greatest stability for the inhabitants of the egg however, and given the 2 year timeline we should expect patterns of getting basic needs met to be establishing to a fair degree in this area. Nevertheless the original contents of the egg play a large role in defining resource limitation. Players should  be able to find normal resources associated with civilization and in some cases nature in a conventional 'scavenger' type capacity from what remains of humanity. On the one hand, two years have passed, meaning many obvious scavenging opportunities have already been looted, however the population still living inside the egg is much less than the original population, meaning there is perhaps (depending on setting) a baseline  looting opportunity.<br><br>Few artifacts were placed in the outer ring originally by the egg, and what artifacts have been generated here are rather mundanely supernatural in their effects. It is possible that humans have transported artifacts here as they recovered them from interior areas, but we should expect those artifacts to be closely guarded by their owners. | - Humans are likely to have _some_ means of getting water, food, shelter, etc. although which is the most limited will be dependent on the area inside the egg. E.g. if it is desert perhaps a dictator rules in one area through control of water.<br>- Prospects for creating new high tech items (ammunition, medical supplies, etc.) may be very limited, unless either large stores exist within the egg's bounds (possibly through luck or containing substantial urban territory) or society has developed some means of manufacture (probably not major) |
| New life      | New life is moreso an issue in the middle and inner rings, although conceivably challenges from the middle and inner rings could on occasion find their way farther out.<br><br>Conventional life proceeds here fairly normally, with its associated benefits and challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | - Maybe _one_ rogue entity breaks through from middle ring.<br>- Perhaps some conventional life challenges (animals, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### The middle ring

 The area between the outer and inner ring is defined by a tension between the life generated by the egg and the conventional life on our planet. Most of the new life is bizarre but ultimately benign, some is subtly antagonistic to humanity and conventional life, and some is overtly attempting to destroy conventional life. The line between conventional and new life is not static, but ebbing and flowing over weeks, days, or even hours in a tension within this ring. Fundamental forces of time, space, and the like are mostly still conventional here (with some exceptions.)

| Social/human  | Humanity is in a mixed relationship with the middle ring. For some it is a place of conflict with what humanity is keeping at bay. For others it is a point of interface between the egg's power and the more stable society in the outer ring. Players should expect to encounter social/human challenges associated with this tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | - Tensions arising from how humanity relates to the new life in this zone<br>- Limitations on passing beyond a certain point<br>- Strange interactions with humans that are not quite right in this zone<br>- Encountering various parties pursuing strange objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Resources     | The tension in the middle ring makes maintaining normal patterns of life more difficult here, and thus access to food, water, and shelter is less reliable in general. Humanity may have outposts here for reasons that go beyond basic sustenance however: perhaps to interface with new life, and the powers of the egg. In places where conventional life is dominant, we should expect some of the same normal resources (water, etc.), but in areas where new life is dominant we might find these things to be subtly or overtly altered.<br><br>The middle ring contains artifacts that are quite impactful but not revolutionary in their power. | - Humans might find water sources to have subtle psychoactive properties.<br>- The player might find strange resources that go beyond the conventional needs of life.<br>- Outposts of humanity exist that are both eager to trade for conventional resources (water, food, etc.) and also havens for what can sustain conventional life in otherwise trying circumstances (e.g. they are shipping in goods in order to continue pursuing objectives in this location.) |
| New life      | New life is a substantial source of challenge in the middle ring. New and conventional life is at a standoff in this zone, in terms of animal, plant, and other forms of life. The player may find themselves accidentally or intentionally in the mix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | - Bizarre new life animal or 'entity' attacks<br>- New life 'plants' slowly growing into and reworking conventional life territory in a destructive (from the conventional life perspective) way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### The inner ring

The inner ring is dominated by 'new life', and most represents the reality that would be created if the egg were to no longer be contained, overlaid on the existing (but modified) geography and infrastructure that existed before in this space. While new life is alien and in conflict with ours, it sometimes has a compelling beauty. In addition to the challenges of encountering new life, some mild disturbances of space, time, and other fundamental forces may exist here sporadically, as a result of the ongoing dynamic creative forces at play.

| Social/human  | -The inner ring is where it may be possible to directly witness the avatars of the planter civilization.

They may be conducting the business of the egg.<br>-Any humans occupying the inner ring are going to be changed to the degree that they have spent time there. Either they are there very briefly, or they have changed themselves substantially to be able to spend more time there (and at some point are perhaps no longer accurately called humans.)                                     | - Humans characters on very plot specific missions<br>- Human beings no longer fully human<br>- Human beings barely human at all any more.<br>- Avatars of the planter civilization (cherubim, ophanim, seraphim, metatron, the watchers, Chayot Ha kodesh, and the like.)<br>- Technology of the planter civilization and their avatars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### The core

The core is an utterly bizarre and alien environment, brimming with creative energy. Fundamental force of time, space, and the like are clearly disturbed here. The core contains artifacts of immense power and ramifications for the fate of the world.

At the epicenter of the core lies something wondrous.

### Artifacts

Each adventure will contain different artifacts: both the artifacts that the player is sent to obtain as a primary objective, and also other artifacts that can be found and influence the world of the game.

Artifact's primary effect can be to enhance its user, or it can be an object that is 'wielded' to have an effect on the world.


* Artifacts are just one of many possible names for the objects. Other names that may be used are 'specimens', 'relics', 'gifts', 'stains', depending on the group's perspective on the objects.
* Artifacts are both a blessing and a curse for the player. Many enhance the player's abilities, but also have side effects commensurate with their strength. 
* Artifacts are relatively rare. They should only be obtainable with time & difficulty, in proportion to their power.
* Artifacts from the 'tree of life' imbue physical and mental benefits, or are objects of utility in and of themselves. Artifacts from the 'tree of knowledge' reveal information to the player. 
* Artifacts may have effects purely by being in proximity to something, they may need to be consumed, or they may be something a person must wield.
* The effect may be embodied by changing the person wielding it (enhancing the user), or the effect may be primarily inherent to the object itself (e.g. a tool, a weapon)
* Effects can be made more or less serious by adjusting duration (short, long, permanent), or strength of effect.

 Artifacts are both a blessing and a curse for the player. Many enhance the player's abilities, but also have side effects commensurate with their strength. 
 Artifacts from the 'tree of life' imbue physical and mental benefits, or are objects of utility in and of themselves. Artifacts from the 'tree of knowledge' reveal information to the player. 

 Physical/mental
	* Enhanced vision - seeing through walls, or clear vision at night, etc.
	* Moderate resistance (or compatibility?) with effects of the egg, new life.
	* Intuition of events in near future (5 seconds)
	* Significant but not total conventional physical protective capacities
	* Significant but not total psychological protective capacities
	* Significant but not total resistance to environmental forces opposed to conventional life
	* Substantial but not total ability to hide oneself from sight.
	* Ability to heal minor to moderate wounds
	* Ability to inflict psychic suffering
	* Ability to instill fear
	* Moderately strong elemental powers (fire, water, wind, electricity, etc.)
	* Modifies a part of the player's body into a form with great utility.
	* Brief mind reading
	* Ability to sense presence of other artifacts
	* Remote viewing
	* Extreme strength
	* Substantially enhanced intelligence
	* Fine-grained telekinesis of small objects
	* Ability to project force at a distance
	* Ability to scream deafeningly
	* Ability to cause cellular breakdown
	* Ability to render a life form temporarily immobile
	* Greatly enhanced reaction speed
	* Extreme willpower
	* Mild physical modification (e.g. enhanced musculature)
* Increased sense of alignment to the egg's force. Increased accidental antagonism and conventional life/humanity.
* Beginning of rejection of normal metabolism (e.g. eating/drinking normal food is harder)
* Destabilizing emotions
* Destabilizing mental state (mild psychosis, mental episodes)
* Sustained sickness
* Weakening of physical strength in proportion to duration of use.

If the artifact's primary effect is embodied within itself, it might be of any of the following nature

* An especially effective tool.
* An especially effective weapon.
* Something that modifies the immediate environment (physical environment, all life in an area, all humans in an area, etc.)
* Something that affects a particular target (a point in space, a location, a life form, another object, etc.)

If the artifacts primary effects is to enhance its user, it might affect them in one of the ways outlined below, including physical enhancement or alteration, enhancement or alteration of abilities (physical or mental), or imbuing knowledge.

Artifacts should generally have a single power, rather than a mix of different abilities.
