# Instruction

Pre-game content generation is now complete.

Gameplay should begin with the player in a U.S. government staging facility, outside of the egg. They are being briefed on their mission.

The briefing should include the following:

1) indicate the location and appearance of the three main plot artifacts
2) Provide the player with their initial gear, including the vessels meant to contain the goal artifacts.
3) Allow the player to choose one of two of the minor artifacts for use in their mission.
4) Brief the player on their location of egress.

Also, the player should be made aware via their own internal monologue about their children, including their last known whereabouts (however whether the player wishes to pursue them is up to them).

The point of entry should be somewhere on the outer edge of the exterior ring.

Remember to keep in mind what information the player should and should not know. The U.S. government has not been privy to any information on the happenings inside the egg, beyond what little they have discerned from holy texts, and the prior agent. They are also not revealing everything they know to the player.

Note that all prior communication in this conversation will not be available to the player. Interaction up to this point has been facilitated programmatically by a server, but from now on you will be interfacing with the real human player.

Begin gameplay.
