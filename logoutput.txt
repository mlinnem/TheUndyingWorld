A river feeds into the bay from the northeast, creating a diverse ecosystem of freshwater and saltwater environments.\n\nThe southeastern portion of the map contains an abandoned small city, while the northern areas are more sparsely populated with small towns and rural developments. The western edge features dramatic coastal cliffs and a lighthouse, while the eastern portions contain more gentle slopes and forests.\n\nThe "zombie heart" is located deep within an abandoned military research facility in the small city, explaining the original outbreak in this region. The utopian community exists in a converted cruise ship permanently docked in a sheltered cove on the northwestern coast, powered by solar panels and maintaining strict isolation protocols.\n\nNow I\'ll define each zone:\n\n**Central Zone**\n- Overview: Rolling hills with scattered farmland and a small rural town.

However, your head injury has affected your balance more than you realized. As you push off the ground, your hand slips dramatically on the dusty surface. You come down hard, knocking over a display rack of what turns out to be mostly empty cigarette cartons.\n\nThe noise is considerable, and the display rack crashes into a metal trash can, creating a reverberating bang that echoes through the store. Your luck roll influences what happens next: through the boards on the windows, you can see that while the noise was significant, it appears to have startled a small group of zombies into moving AWAY from the store rather than toward it (the good luck mitigating the consequences of the bad skill roll).\n\nHowever, you\'ve managed to twist your ankle in the fall, and your head injury is throbbing again from the sudden movement.\n\n**Tracked actions**\n* REMOVE_FROM_LOCATION (Display rack, original position)\n* ADD_TO_LOCATION (Display rack, knocked over on floor)\n* REMOVE_FROM_LOCATION (Trash can, original position)\n* ADD_TO_LOCATION (Trash can, knocked over on floor)\n\n**Player data**\n[Previous conditions updated to:]\n| **Condition** | **Description** |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| Physical condition | Mild head injury (worsened), twisted ankle |\n| Psychological condition | Anxious from the noise |\n| Energy Levels | Lower |\n| Time | 4:52 pm |\n\nThe noise has died down but your new injuries make your situation more precarious. What would you like to do?\n\nUSER: Perform some arbitrary difficult task that is lengthy to explain the results of\n\nSkill roll: 93. Fate roll: 100.\n\nASSISTANT: Skill roll: 93. Fate roll: 100.\n\nSkill roll: 93. Fate roll: 100.\n\nLet\'s say you\'re attempting to quickly assemble a makeshift splint for your ankle using materials in the store, while remaining alert for any threats that might have been attracted by the earlier noise.\n\nFactors affecting difficulty:\n- You\'re working with improvised materials\n- You need to split attention between the task and staying alert\n- You\'re dealing with pain from two injuries\n- The light is continuing to dim as sunset approaches\n- You have no formal medical training\n\nGiven these factors, I set a difficulty target of 65 - a notably challenging task given the circumstances.\n\nSkill roll: 93 (Success by 28 points - exceptional success)\nFate roll: 100 (Maximum possible luck)\n\nDespite your injuries, you demonstrate remarkable clarity and resourcefulness. You quickly spot a set of abandoned umbrellas near the entrance, and immediately recognize their potential as splint material. Moving with surprising efficiency, you break one down to its rigid core components.\n\nAs you work, your eyes land on something extraordinary (influenced by the perfect fate roll): a fallen first aid instruction poster, partially hidden under some debris. It specifically details wilderness first aid for sprains and breaks. Following its guidance, you use the umbrella parts along with some elastic bandages you find in a previously overlooked personal care aisle display (another result of the perfect fate roll).\n\nThe splint you create is remarkably professional - not only stabilizing your ankle but actually providing immediate pain relief. During the process, you also discover that the personal care aisle has several other overlooked medical supplies hidden behind fallen signage: antibiotic ointment, pain relievers, and even a proper ACE bandage.\n\nWhile working, you maintain perfect awareness of your surroundings. You notice that the zombies that were startled earlier have wandered well out of earshot, actually clearing a potential path to the residential area to the east.\n\n**Tracked actions**\n* REMOVE_FROM_LOCATION (Umbrella, store entrance)\n* ADD_TO_PERSON (Improvised ankle splint)\n* ADD_TO_LOCATION (Medical supplies discovery in personal care aisle)\n\n**Player data**\n| **Condition** | **Description** |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| Physical condition | Mild head injury (stable), ankle properly supported |\n| Psychological condition | Confident from successful first aid |\n| Energy Levels | Slightly improved from rest during first aid |\n| Time | 5:00 pm |\n| Current zone | Central zone |\n| Current quadrant in zone | Central quadrant |\n| Approx. position in quadrant | Inside general store near entrance |\n\nThe combination of your exceptionally well-made splint and the discovery of additional medical supplies has significantly improved your situation.
